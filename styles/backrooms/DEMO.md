Demo: *Night Shift Orientation* (59.7 s) · `backrooms.mp4` · source in [`demo/`](demo/)


## Story & structure

A new night-shift worker films his orientation walk through an endless office floor, following the printed rules and the PA. The original style notes, as written for this demo:

A single first-person **camcorder recording** (1990s VHS, 4:3) walking through an **empty, familiar-but-wrong interior**: mustard wallpaper, damp carpet, drop ceilings full of humming fluorescent panels, repeating forever. Nothing chases anyone. The dread comes from **emptiness, repetition, bureaucratic rules, and the camera's own machinery failing at the wrong moment**. The viewer should feel a chill on the back of the neck, not jump out of their seat.

**Never** use the word "Backrooms", wiki "Level" numbers, community entity names, or any existing organisation/logo inside the film. The genre name lives only in this file. Everything on screen — rules, forms, company voice, the "thing" — is original.

The recording medium is the storyteller. The demo used all five native powers and put the focus hunt at the emotional peak:

| Native power | How the demo used it |
|---|---|
| **Autofocus / auto-exposure hunting** | The camera "finds" something only while focus is correct. It is there on the first lock, gone on the second. AE lags after a blackout and the image pumps with gain noise. |
| **Tape tracking damage** | A tracking tear is a *cut the universe made*. Same framing afterwards, but the OSD clock jumped hours / the battery drained / one light is now dead. |
| **The OSD is plot** | REC dot, battery, date and time code are diegetic evidence. A camcorder title-generator can write the film's title over the first shot. |
| **Rules as text in frame** | Printed notices, PA announcements in a calm corporate voice. Rules start ordinary and drift wrong; two of them contradict each other; the last one addresses the viewer. |
| **Emptiness and repetition** | The same notice appears again in a different place; the same room with one detail changed; a corridor that runs into fog. Emptiness itself is the threat. |

How we framed the topic (the same trick works for others): turn the topic into **an orientation, a procedure, or a checklist** that someone records on tape — a new job's first shift, a building inspection, a moving-day walkthrough, a school's safety drill, a hotel's night audit. Write 5–6 rules. Let the medium betray the rules.

**Demo emotional arc (59.7 s):** boring normal (≈20 s of almost nothing) → a small wrongness (a contradiction, a repeated notice) → a rule is tested (lights flicker) → seeing / not seeing (focus hunt) → time removed (tracking tear) → a rule is broken (the exit) → the last rule turns to the audience → REC off. One subject (the camera operator — heard, never seen above the shoes), one goal (follow the procedure), one turn (the time code proves he is no longer in "normal").

## Shots

| Beat | Camera |
|---|---|
| Opening | Tape rolls in, AWB swings blue→yellow, AF finds a notice on a wall; camcorder title over it |
| Reveal of space | Slow pan off the notice to a corridor of partitions and lights receding into fog |
| Routine | Walking POV, glance down at shoes on damp carpet; no events for ~20 s |
| The contradiction | Crouch to a repeated notice; hold ≥4 s with nothing covering the text |
| Obeying a rule | Snap down to the shoes; let the light on the carpet change instead of showing the ceiling |
| Peak | Zoom + autofocus hunt down the corridor; the figure exists only in the ~0.5 s of correct focus |
| Time cut | Tracking tear, then the *identical* framing — only the OSD changed |
| Breaking a rule | Turn a corner to the red EXIT; hold still in total silence; push in; door opens on its own |
| Ending | Final notice in focus ≥3 s → REC off: freeze, tear, black |

**The "thing"** is never a close-up: a 2.4 m silhouette (a colleague who is wrong by 15–40 %: small head, long tilted neck, narrow high shoulders, arms to the knee), drawn as an organic Canvas2D silhouette on a camera-facing billboard, ~33 m away in a stretch of dead lights with only dim light far behind it. Slow small wave (3.6 s cycle). Target: *you can tell it is waving, you cannot count fingers.* Exclude the billboard from the GTAO pre-pass (`mesh.isPoints = true`) or it stamps a dark rectangle.

Demo motion numbers: 0.72 m stride, head bob 3 cm, sway 1.8 cm, roll ±0.8°, breathing 0.27 Hz, tremor at 1, 3.5 and 9 Hz; looking down at pitch ≈ −1.2 rad with the camera pushed 0.2 m forward; zoom FOV 52° → 27° with aperture ×5; three 0.1 s blackouts per flicker, AE lag ~0.45 s; doors open in 1.3 s. The original motion section:

- **One continuous handheld take.** Cuts happen only where the tape breaks: power-on roll-in, tracking tear, REC off.
- Handheld = walking gait (0.72 m stride, head bob 3 cm, sway 1.8 cm, roll ±0.8°) + breathing (0.27 Hz) + tremor noise at 1, 3.5 and 9 Hz whose amplitude rises with a **fear** curve. At the "held breath" moment **freeze all of it**.
- Looking down: pitch ≈ −1.2 rad, camera pushed 0.2 m forward — only the shoe toes and carpet in frame, never trouser legs.
- Autofocus is the DOF focus distance animated with overshoot: blur → lock → slip → lock. Blur comes from pulling focus *near* (a far target barely blurs when focus overshoots to infinity). Zoom narrows FOV 52°→27° and raises aperture ×5.
- Lights flicker as three 0.1 s blackouts; AE brightens with ~0.45 s lag afterwards.
- Doors open by themselves, slowly (1.3 s, eased).

## Score structure

There is no score. The sound design as built for the demo:

- **No score.** Only what the tape would have recorded.
- **Fluorescent bed**: 120 Hz + harmonics (1, .55, .42, .22, .16, .06 at ×1…×7), a buzzy band-passed square component, a faint ~9 kHz ballast whine, random bad-tube "zzz" bursts; gated by the same light curve as the picture; +3 dB closer in small rooms.
- **PA**: calm corporate voice (Kokoro `af_bella`, speed 0.82–0.84) through a "ceiling speaker": band-pass ~310–3500 Hz, cone resonance around 1.3 kHz, tanh saturation, room reverb — keep it dry enough for whisper to transcribe (too much reverb made "night shift" into "my church"). Original two-note chime (vibraphone E5→C5) before every rule; after the time jump both chime and voice drift flat with tape wow.
- **Operator**: 3–4 short lines (`am_michael`), low level, proximity bass, a breath/air layer following the voice envelope, compressed. Kokoro cannot truly whisper — "speaking quietly" is the goal. Close-mic breathing whose rate follows the fear curve; held breath then one long exhale.
- **Diegetic hold music**: an original easy-listening loop (here 88 BPM F major, vibraphone melody, clean-guitar comps on 2 & 4, finger bass), band-passed and drowned in reverb as if through walls, read with a slowing tape-speed curve (1.00 → 0.97 → 0.89) and growing wow. It cuts out during blackouts and dies at the silence, never to return.
- **Foley**: damp-carpet steps (60–85 Hz thud + small wet 0.9–2.6 kHz squelch), cloth rustles on turns, camcorder clack + motor on REC on/off, zoom servo whine, AF motor ticks, ballast "tink" + arc buzz on each flicker, a barely audible drag overhead, door latch + stick-slip hinge creak + air push.
- **Silence is the climax**: one full second of digital zero (including tails) when the exit appears; caption `[SILENCE]`. The only allowed scare is soft: all ballasts restriking at once with a low thunk when sound returns.
- Low drone (35–55 Hz brown noise + 41/43.5 Hz beating) rising from the time jump to the silence. Duck bed and music ≈ −8 dB under voices. Loudness −14 LUFS, grain 0 (the noise is in the picture).

## Palette & props

- **Frame**: 4:3 image pillarboxed in 1920×1080 (black side bars). Render the 3D at **720×540** and let the VHS pass upscale — low resolution is part of the look and hides CG cleanliness.
- **Space**: axis-aligned partition walls 0.16 m thick on a 2.4 m grid, random gaps and stubs, occasional square pillars; ceiling 2.70 m; drop-ceiling tiles 0.6×1.2 m; recessed troffers every 2.4 m (0.6×1.2 m prismatic panels). A hand-authored route (start room → long corridor → side corridor → one small room) inside procedurally filled offices so every doorway shows more empty rooms.
- **Lighting = thousands of lights, no shadows**: store every troffer's colour/intensity in a 128×128 float **DataTexture**; each fragment sums the nearest 5×5 panels (emitter cosine × Lambert / (d²+0.3)) plus a bounce term from the same neighbourhood. No occlusion — backrooms light is flat. Per-light variation: ±8 % warm/cool, +0–7 % green, 3.5 % dead, 2.5 % flickering. GTAO (radius ≈0.55 m) darkens wall/floor seams.
- **Fog follows local light**: fog colour × (local bounce light / average). Where lights are dead the haze is dark too, so a silhouette there reads as a *hole in the light*. Scene background = fog × 0.15, so corridors dissolve into darkness instead of a bright wall.
- **Palette** (albedo, sRGB): wallpaper `#d5bd66` with darker stripes `rgba(140,112,40,.7)` and a diamond column, every roll faded differently; baseboard `#4d3d26`; carpet `#8c763c` mottled, damp patches ×0.6 with faint specular; ceiling tile `#d9d3b8`, grid `#e6e1cf`; troffer diffuser `#fbfaf0` at emissive ×5; the **only saturated colour is the red EXIT sign** (`#ff2a1a`, emissive ×9 so it blooms).
- **Restrained decay** (clean is part of the style — never make it a ruin): water tide-marks at the foot of *some* wall runs, nicotine-yellow band under the ceiling, occasional peeling seam (≈7 % of rolls, pale paper-back triangle + shadow), rare small stains, ~4 % yellowed ceiling tiles, ~2 % return-air grilles, <1 % missing tiles (black holes), dead insects inside diffusers.
- **Notices**: office laser-print on yellowed paper: IBM Plex Sans Condensed headers ("FLOOR STAFF — PLEASE READ", "FORM NS-01 (REV. 9)"), numbered rules in Plex Sans 600, "Thank you for your cooperation. — Management". Pinned to cork or taped to wallpaper. For close-ups, **lower the camera so the lens is parallel to the page** — pitching down at a vertical sheet shears the words into fake italics.
- **VHS camcorder pass** (custom shader, *not* a CRT): per-line time-base jitter (small; low-frequency wobble ≤0.25 px or text skews), head-switching band on the bottom 8 lines, tracking tear on demand; barrel distortion 0.07 + vignette 0.42 applied to the image but **not** to the OSD; luma bandwidth limit (Gaussian σ≈1.25 px @720) + edge-enhancement ringing (sharp 0.9); chroma averaged over ±10 px and shifted 1.6 px right; bright lights smear to the right; AWB tint drifting; AGC noise (streaky, stronger in darks); 0–2 dropout lines per frame; black lift 0.045, soft highlight clip. Noise runs at 30 fps (tape rate) even though output is 24 fps. No scanlines, no RGB mask.
- **OSD**: a hand-made 5×7 bitmap font with a black outline: `● REC` top-left, battery top-right, `PM 11:58` / `SEP.27.1996` bottom-right. The title uses the same font ×2 like a camcorder title generator.

## Titles & subtitles

- **CEA-608-style closed captions**: IBM Plex Mono 600, 42 px, white on a solid black box per row, ≤32 characters per row, centred inside the 4:3 frame just above the OSD clock. They are not affected by tape noise (the TV decodes them).
- Speaker marks: `[PA]` prefix for announcements; italics for the operator (first line tagged `(whispering)`); SDH sound descriptions in brackets: `[FLUORESCENT LIGHTS HUMMING]`, `[LIGHTS FLICKER]`, `[TAPE NOISE]`, `[SILENCE]`.
- Rules on notices are *not* captioned — they are the picture. Keep text readable at 1080p and give each notice ≥3–4 s uncovered.
- Title: camcorder title-generator bitmap text typed over the first shot.

### Pitfalls we hit

- A fully bright scene reads as a hospital corridor. Break walls into partitions with gaps; let far areas fall dark.
- Lights leak through walls (no occlusion) — a "dead zone" needs all lights within ±5 m across dead, and the corridor behind it dim too, or the figure is framed against a bright window.
- The scene background showed as a bright rectangle at the corridor's end — set background = fog × 0.15.
- A uniform fog colour lifts silhouettes to grey; make fog follow local light.
- Low-frequency line wobble in the VHS pass skews text; keep it ≤0.25 px. Camera pitched down at a notice made words look italic — lower the camera instead.
- Capsule-built figures read as toys / stick men. Draw the silhouette as organic curves on a billboard.
- Legs from primitives look like tubes; show only shoe toes (extruded footprint outline with bevel, lighter sole, laces).
- Emissive red at ×3 never reached the bloom threshold (luminance of pure red is low); use ×9.
- Normalising a filtered chime by the *pre-filter* peak blew the PA bus up by 16 dB — normalise by the processed signal.
- Heavy PA reverb destroys intelligibility; check every processed line with whisper and the full mix too.
- Time-compressing a finished timeline: write keyframes in "original" time and map them through one piecewise-linear warp `W()`; remember to warp any hard-coded times elsewhere.
- VHS noise makes files big: CRF 24 → ~47 MB for 60 s.
