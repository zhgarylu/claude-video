## Story & structure

A product set-up guide for a fictional robot vacuum, Pip (the first use case in STYLE.md §11). It fits a product page, a QR code on the box, or a help centre. The old guide framed every film in this style as "a 30–40 second scene film: the user gives you the thing and its steps; you decide the shots, the timing, the sound and the score"; that framing now lives in STYLE.md.

Structure: hook reveal ("Meet Pip.", the box opens on a mustard ground) → one scene per step (wide + round detail call-out): ① set the dock against a wall (50 cm clear each side), ② pair the phone (2.4 GHz), ③ hold the start button (one second) → payoff (the vacuum's route drawn over the floor plan) → tip → poster lockup (the three steps as medallions) → iris-out end card.

The presenter, **June**, a new homeowner: an egg head with a long pointed nose that is part of the face's outline, a bob with a mustard headband, a coral turtleneck and navy cigarette trousers (the treatment explains why she is not a 1950s "housewife"). Her body is a held drawing; hands are four-finger gloves in four shapes: open, flat, point and grip. Scenes: one colour plane, a floor band, a horizon with gaps, and props such as a wall edge, a socket, a phone.

The demo's reference for how the moves served information:

**How the native moves serve information (not story):**
- **Off-register colour** makes a flat info card feel hand-made, and warm enough to sit on a product page. Keep it on everything, text included.
- **Limited animation** points the eye. When the body is still, the hand is the only thing moving, and that hand *is* the step. Give every step one hand action with anticipation → action → follow-through, landing on a beat.
- **The round call-out** (a manual's magnifier) is the close-up. The wide stays for context and the hands get big inside the circle. The step's data (50 cm, 2.4 GHz, one second) lands inside or on that circle on the action beat, never as a slide.
- **The numbered medallion** is both a hierarchy marker and a door. It stamps onto the outgoing scene's subject, and the camera goes through it into the next step.
- **The payoff turns function into ornament.** In the demo, the vacuum's real route (wall-follow, then boustrophedon lanes that flow around furniture, with a small curl at every turn, stars and dots between lanes) draws itself room by room, one room per beat. Stepping back, it reads as an atomic-age textile.

## Shots

The camera is always "the stand": pushes, trucks, tilts, pull-backs, never handheld. The demo used one transition grammar, **the circle**:

| Move | Where in the demo | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Slow push 1.00 → 1.07 | Hook | Collects the eye onto the product on its stage |
| **Iris through the medallion** (circle grows from the stamp to full frame, 0.9 beat) | Every step change | The step number *is* the door |
| Truck right + gentle push | Step 1 wide | Follows the push toward the wall |
| Round detail call-out (frame in frame, with a dashed leader line to its subject) | Every step | Constant line weight at close-up scale; context stays visible |
| Push into the phone, then pan along the signal rings | Step 2 | From person → interface → device |
| Tilt down with the finger | Step 3 | The press is the most important action; the finger leads the frame |
| **Button → iris → top view** | Step 3 → payoff | The start button opens into the plan; circle to circle |
| **Pull-back + counter-rotation, 5.4× → 1.0×, −6° → 0°** (signature) | Payoff | Scale reveal: one lane → a whole flat printed like a textile |
| Colour-block wipe (side for the tip, bottom-up for the lockup) | Tip, lockup | Changes the "page" of the manual |
| Dead still ≥ 3 s | Lockup | Tells the viewer: this frame is the one to screenshot |
| **Iris-out onto the product**, end card inside a circle | End | The classic cartoon ending, and the last circle |

Why this route, for this job: every step change went through its own number, so the hierarchy was also the edit; the button → top view iris joined the most important action to its result; the pull-back gave the one "wow" of the film to the product's real behaviour; the dead-still lockup is the screenshot. Each is one choice from STYLE.md §6, not the style's default opening or ending.

Timeline (built from content): hook 4 bars, each step ≥ 3 bars (from its voice length), the last step 2 bars, then payoff 3, tip 2, lockup 3 and end 2 bars at 132 BPM. Three steps = 22 bars = 40.0 s. Key subjects ≥ 1/3 frame height and out of the bottom 140 px (the caption card).

## Score structure

- **Music:** an original West-Coast cool-jazz combo at **132 BPM**: vibraphone (chords, arpeggios, glissandi, motor tremolo), flute (melody), pizzicato upright bass (walking), brushes (a swirl plus 2 and 4, sticks on the ride for the payoff), a celesta colour. **Every step lands on its own vibraphone chord** (F6, B♭maj7, C9), and the lockup brings those chords back one per medallion, transposed. In the payoff the vibraphone plays "one note per lap", driven by lap times exported in `events.json`.
- **Rhythm arc:** normal → double-time at the payoff (key up a whole step) → half-time for the tip (the breath) → normal for the lockup.
- **Silences:** A (0–1.36 s): no music, only the box. B (the last beat before the press): *everything* off, ambience included, so the first sound after it is the start click. C (before the lockup): room tone only. The first sound after silence C is the first medallion stamp.
- **J/L cuts:** music enters before the reveal; each step's line starts half a beat before its iris; the motor starts 0.2 s before the payoff; the last Wi-Fi pip rings into step 3; the payoff's glissando tail rings into the tip.
- **Ambience:** warm room tone (low-passed brown noise, about −42 dB) and a very quiet mantel-clock tick on the half-note grid. In the payoff, Pip's motor hum (a band-passed saw with a slow LFO plus brush hiss) takes over.
- **Foley in this film:** the box (creak, flap thumps a semitone apart, a swish into a slap), the plug click, floor scrapes for the dock, stamps for every medallion, slide whistles for the 50 cm arrows, rising pips for "connected", pen scratches as each room's route draws, the ink line peeling off paper, an iris "shhk".
- **Mix:** narration compressed on top, music ducks 8 dB under it, foley unducked, −14 LUFS, true peak −1.2. `tools/cuecheck.py` found 0 hits off the half-beat grid.
- **Narrator:** calm classroom authority. The demo uses Kokoro `am_michael` at 0.94. `bm_george` was tried: whisper heard "dock" as "dark" in his British vowel. Keep lines to one clause: "Step one. Set the dock against a wall."

## Palette & props

**Palette (demo; every value is a content.json field):**

| Role | Hex |
|---|---|
| Paper | `#F4EAD5` (shade `#E6D8BC`, `#D4C29F`) |
| Ink (warm black) | `#2B2420` |
| Coral (accent, June's sweater) | `#E4613F` / dark `#B8452B` |
| Mustard (hook ground, belts, dots) | `#E8B43A` / light `#F3D37F` |
| Turquoise (the product) | `#3FA7A0` / dark `#257A74` |
| Dusty blue / avocado / pink / plum (step grounds) | `#7F9CC0` · `#A7AE5B` · `#F0B4A8` · `#6E4A6B` |
| Navy (trousers) · hair · skin | `#3B4766` · `#3A2621` · `#F2C7A0` |
| Kraft (box) | `#C9955D` / `#A2713F` / `#DDB47F` |

- **One ground colour per scene**, lighter tint for walls (`tint(col, .45)`), darker shade for floors (`shade(col, .16)`). Never place the product on its own colour or June on coral/pink.
- **Line:** 3–5 px ink ribbons with ±40 % width breathing and 12–25 % breaks. Characters: 4 px. Props: 3–4.5 px. Walls in plans: 6–7 px, broken. Hands: one 6 px outline around the union of palm and fingers, 2.4 px finger separations.
- **Shading:** one flat darker plane clipped inside a shape (never a gradient). Drop shadows are a copy of the shape offset (12, 12) in a paper shade at 50 %.
- **Ornaments:** 4-point atomic sparkles, 8–18-point starbursts, sunburst rays (30 wedges, 55 % alpha), boomerang and kidney shapes, polka dots.
- **Type:** Oleo Script Bold for the kicker ("Meet Pip."); Alfa Slab One for titles, numerals and step headers (ink with a cream or colour plate offset 4–7 px); Jost 500/600 for body, details, labels and captions (letter-spaced caps for small labels).
- **Grain:** light (mux grain 4) plus the paper overlay; the look is print, not film.

Demo numbers behind the STYLE.md rules: register offset `(6, 4)` px re-rolled at 12 fps ±1.6 px; walls in plans 6–7 px broken; hands one 6 px outline and 2.4 px finger separations; drop shadow offset (12, 12); sunburst 30 wedges at 55 % alpha; mux grain 4; walls `tint(col, .45)`, floors `shade(col, .16)`; pop-ins 0.24–0.3 s with overshoot 1.9; hand anticipation 20–60 px, recoil 6–10 px; kneel drops the hips 150 units (`kneel: true`, `kneelPose()`); caption card Jost 500 42 px, 60 px above the bottom, fade 0.16 s with a 10 px rise, colour cel offset 5 px, coral 8-point stars; step title Alfa Slab 64 px; detail tags Jost 36 px.

**The payoff:** the vacuum's real route (wall-follow, then boustrophedon lanes that flow around furniture, with a small curl at every turn, stars and dots between lanes) draws itself room by room, one room per beat, while the camera pulls back 5.4× → 1.0× with a −6° → 0° counter-rotation. Stepping back, it reads as an atomic-age textile.

## End card

After the lockup, inside the iris circle: film title, style name, `Lemo-Opuscar`, `LemoLab × Claude Opus 5.5`, asset credits. The LemoLab sign-off belongs to this library's demo only; a user's film carries no LemoLab credit and no copy of this card.

## Build notes

1. `demo/content.json` holds every word, number, colour, the voice and the payoff plan. `python3 demo/tools/lines.py` turns it into `lines.json`.
2. Kokoro (`core/tts/tts.py`) → `voices/` + `dur.json`; `asr_check.py` until every line is OK (step numbers are compared as digits).
3. The timeline is built from content (see Shots).
4. The score (`music/score.py`, forked to a sub-agent with the cue map) → `score.wav`, stems and `hits.json`.
5. `core/render/events.mjs` exports the same event times the pictures use. `tools/cuecheck.py` checks every hit against the half-beat grid and the score. `mix.py` builds foley, voice, ducking and the three silences.
6. `tools/cues.mjs` → `.srt`; render with `core/render/video.mjs` (960 frames ≈ 30 s with 2 workers, through `core/render/slot.mjs`); `mux.sh … 24 4`.
7. `sh demo/build.sh` does all of it; `sh demo/build.sh stills` renders the content-swap test.

Pitfalls tied to this demo's props:

1. `demo/content.json` holds every word, number, colour, the voice and the payoff plan. `python3 demo/tools/lines.py` turns it into `lines.json`.
2. Kokoro (`core/tts/tts.py`) → `voices/` + `dur.json`; `asr_check.py` until every line is OK (step numbers are compared as digits).
3. The timeline is built from content: hook 4 bars, each step ≥ 3 bars (from its voice length), the last step 2 bars, then payoff 3, tip 2, lockup 3 and end 2 bars at 132 BPM. Three steps = 22 bars = 40.0 s.
4. The score (`music/score.py`, forked to a sub-agent with the cue map) → `score.wav`, stems and `hits.json`.
5. `core/render/events.mjs` exports the same event times the pictures use. `tools/cuecheck.py` checks every hit against the half-beat grid and the score (0 off in the demo). `mix.py` builds foley, voice, ducking and the three silences.
6. `tools/cues.mjs` → `.srt`; render with `core/render/video.mjs` (960 frames ≈ 30 s with 2 workers); `mux.sh … 24 4`.
7. `sh demo/build.sh` does all of it; `sh demo/build.sh stills` renders the content-swap test.

## content.json fields

Everything readable and every colour comes from `demo/content.json`. The page reads `?content=<file>` for tests.

| Field | Type | Range | If out of range |
|---|---|---|---|
| `product` | string | 1–12 chars | Squeezed to fit on the box label (`maxW`) |
| `kind` | string | free | Only for your own reference |
| `title` / `subtitle` | string | ≤ 36 / ≤ 24 chars | Title wraps to 2 lines in the hook, shrinks to 50 px on the lockup |
| `hook.kicker` / `hook.line` | string | ≤ 14 chars / one sentence | Kicker squeezed to 760 px; the line becomes the first caption |
| `steps[]` | array | **2–5** | Each step adds ≥ 3 bars (5.45 s); the lockup row respaces (R 104 → 88 px beyond 3 steps). 4 steps ≈ 45 s: trim the tip or end card if you need ≤ 40 s |
| `steps[].title` | string | ≤ 22 chars | Shrinks to 40 px (header), wraps to 2 lines (lockup) |
| `steps[].detail` | string | ≤ 30 chars | Wraps to 2 lines; must be readable in its window (chars/12 + 1 s) |
| `steps[].icon` | enum | the 18 icon names | Unknown → `spark` |
| `steps[].action` | enum | `place` (push to a wall + clearance diagram; uses `measure`), `tap` (phone pairing, signal rings to the product), `press` (finger + hold ring); anything else → `show` (icon in hand, finger taps it in the call-out) | — |
| `steps[].measure` | string | e.g. "50 cm" | Only for `place`; empty = arrows without labels |
| `steps[].line` | string | one short sentence | Voice + caption; a long line lengthens its step |
| `payoff.caption` | string | ≤ 40 chars | Shrinks to 26 px |
| `payoff.plan` | object | `y0,y1`, `dock[x,y]`, `zones[]` (name, x0, x1, color, checks), `rug`, `items[]` (shape: sofa, kidney, boomerang, chair, plant, table, bed; x, y, s, rot, color, accent) in 1920×1080 plan px | Zones narrower than 400 px get the wall-follow loop only; items become flow obstacles automatically |
| `tip.label/text/icon/line` | strings | text ≤ 40 chars | Header shrinks; the ribbon widens |
| `outro.line` / `outro.cta` | string | cta ≤ 48 chars | CTA shrinks to 20 px |
| `palette` | object | `paper, ink, product, productDark, accent, hook, steps[], tip` | Missing keys fall back to the demo palette |
| `voice` | object | Kokoro `id`, `speed` | — |
| `film` | object | `name, style, credits` | End card |

**Steps to swap (technical check):** edit `content.json` → `sh demo/build.sh` (it rebuilds lines, voice + whisper check, events, mix, captions, video). The score is written for 22 bars; if your step count changes the length, rerun the music sub-agent with the new section table, or keep 3 steps.

**Minimal example** (only what changes):
```json
{
  "product": "Mo", "title": "Your New Robot Mower", "subtitle": "Set Up in 4 Steps",
  "hook": { "kicker": "Meet Mo.", "line": "Meet Mo, your new robot mower." },
  "steps": [
    { "title": "Set the base station", "detail": "Level ground, 1 m clear in front", "icon": "dock", "action": "place", "measure": "1 m", "line": "Step one. Set the base station on level ground." },
    { "title": "Peg the boundary wire", "detail": "30 cm in from the lawn edge", "icon": "cable", "action": "show", "line": "Step two. Peg the wire around the lawn." }
  ],
  "palette": { "product": "#E4613F", "accent": "#3FA7A0", "hook": "#7F9CC0" }
}
```
`demo/content_alt.json` is the full version of that example (a 4-step robot mower on a garden plan); its stills are in `demo/stills/alt_*.jpg`.

Swapping this file and running `build.sh` checks that the engine re-flows; it is not how a user's film is made.

## Engine reference

`demo/engine/toon.js` (the style), `demo/engine/chars.js` (the presenter, hands and product), `demo/engine/icons.js` (18 icons). All functions draw in the current canvas transform.

| Function | What it draws | Key params |
|---|---|---|
| `setClock(t)` | Sets the clock for the on-twos register jitter; call once per frame | `t` seconds |
| `shape(ctx, pts, o)` | **Any shape in this style**: off-register fill + tooth + broken ink line | `fill`, `line` (px), `off` [dx,dy] (default: jittered `REG`), `grain` 0–1, `breaks` 0–1, `shade` [{pts,color,alpha}], `seed` |
| `ink(ctx, pts, w, o)` | Pressure ink ribbon along a polyline | `closed`, `breaks`, `wob`, `taper`, `color`, `upto` 0–1 (draw-on) |
| `plane(ctx, pts, fill)` | Lineless ground plane | `off`, `grain` |
| `text(ctx, str, x, y, o)` | Two-plate lettering | `font`, `fill`, `plate` (off-register colour plate), `off`, `align`, `rot`, `maxW`, `track` |
| `fit(ctx, str, fam, px, maxW, maxLines, minPx)` | Wraps, then shrinks to fit | returns `{font, px, lines}` |
| `arrow(ctx, from, to, o)` | The moving manual arrow | `u` draw-on, `bob` beat phase, `bend`, `head`, `fill`, `dashedShaft` |
| `star` / `sparkle` / `rays` / `atom` / `kidney` / `boomerang` | Mid-century ornaments | radius, points, rotation, fill |
| `REG` | Global register: `{dx:6, dy:4, jit:1.6, on:true}` | set `REG.on = false` for crisp diagrams |
| `drawOwner(ctx, pose, t)` | The presenter | `x,y,s,dir,view('front'/'q'/'side'/'back'),face('neutral'/'happy'/'wow'/'focus'/'wink'),armF/armB{a1,a2},handF/handB,kneel,blink,look,prop{kind:'phone'/'dock'/'cable'}` |
| `drawHand(ctx, x, y, angle, kind, side, scale)` | Four-finger glove: `'open'`, `'flat'`, `'point'`, `'grip'` | — |
| `drawPip(ctx, x, y, o)` | Round robot product | `view('side'/'top')`, `s`, `light`, `press`, `brush`, `ang`, `colors{product,productD,trim,light}` |
| `icon(ctx, name, cx, cy, size, o)` | Icon library: dock, phone, start, cable, wifi, plug, water, beans, cup, filter, box, clock, check, leaf, key, bulb, spark, gear | `main`, `light`, `dark` |

Film-level helpers in `film.js` you can lift: `callout()` (round detail view with a leader line), `medallionAt()` (numbered stamp), `tag()` (detail card), `stepHeader()`, the potential-flow `laneY()` + `buildPath()` route generator, and the transition block in `renderFilm()` (medallion iris, button iris, colour-block wipe, iris-out).

**Minimal example: a warm-orange four-point spark with a cursor-tail, in this style** (the "only colour" slot: keep `fill` fixed while the scene recolours):
```js
import { setClock, shape, ink, sparkle, starPts, spline, PAL } from './engine/toon.js';
setClock(t);                                   // register jitter on twos
ctx.fillStyle = PAL.paper; ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 1920, 1080);
// the tail: a broken ink stroke that draws on
ink(ctx, spline([[520, 700], [700, 640], [860, 560]], false, 10), 6, { upto: Math.min(1, t / 0.6), breaks: 0.2 });
// the spark: any closed path -> off-register fill + breathing ink line
const pts = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) { const a = i * Math.PI / 4 - Math.PI / 2, r = i % 2 ? 26 : 110; pts.push([960 + Math.cos(a) * r, 520 + Math.sin(a) * r]); }
shape(ctx, pts, { fill: '#D97757', line: 4.5, grain: 0.3, breaks: 0.15 });
sparkle(ctx, 1040, 440, 28, { fill: PAL.white });
```
