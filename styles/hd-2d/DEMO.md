## Story & structure

A harbour town's lighthouse goes out; the old keeper hands the last flame to his granddaughter Wren, who carries her lantern through a night forest and up a storm-beaten cliff stair to relight the lighthouse, so the ships at sea can find their way home. Tagline: *Every path begins with a single light.*

How the demo spent the style's native powers:

| Native power | Story use |
|---|---|
| **A light the hero carries** | The lantern is both key light and plot: Wren carries one small light that must reach the lighthouse. Its brightness is the emotional meter: bright → guttering → almost out → relit. |
| **Tabletop world** | Places read as *maps*: a harbour town, a forest path, a cliff stair, a tower top. One location per chapter, each with its own light key. The opening set returns at the end to show the change (harbour: lighthouse dark → lit, ships' lamps appear). |
| **RPG grammar** | "Chapter I" card, a named NPC who hands over the quest in a dialogue box, a journey through two biomes, a climax at a landmark, a title card. |
| **Sprite shadows** | The first lighting (brazier taper → lantern) happens on screen, next to two characters, so both shadows jump onto the planks. |
| **Tilt-shift** | Extra-wide establishing shots with the focus band on a single tiny subject (the lighthouse, a boat). |

**Our story shape:** cold chapter card → wide establishing shot where the landmark light **fails** → quest handed over in a dialogue box (the light is passed) → travel through a darker biome (forest) → the ordeal (storm; the light almost dies; the music drops out) → the light survives → the landmark is relit (climax on a music downbeat) → the opening set, transformed → title and tagline.

We kept it to 6 shots, one set per 1–2 shots, 7 narrated lines + 1 dialogue line. The "one small light" was a lantern; in another film it could be a first commit, a seed, a letter, a signal — or no carried light at all.

## Shots

| Shot | Camera |
|---|---|
| Establishing (harbour wide, 5.5–15) | Very high and far (`[-17,15,38] → [-13,12,31]`, fov 36), slow push. Focus 44 m, aperture 520; tilt band fixed at 34 % screen height (no character to track). |
| Dialogue (pier, 15–25.5) | Medium-high 3/4 (≈5 m up, 8–10 m away, fov 30), almost static drift. Focus on the hero every frame, aperture 300. |
| Travel (forest, 25.5–35.5) | **Lateral tracking**, camera leads the walker slightly (`monotone` look-ahead), fov 30, 6.3 m up; near ferns in front of the lens blur into dark shapes; she walks behind a foreground trunk at the end. Aperture 380. |
| Ordeal (storm stairs, 35.5–49.5) | Starts as a huge establishing view of the cliff, eases into a follow cam (37–39 s), then **dives low and close** as she kneels (camera to ~2.2 m up, 6 m away), and pulls back as she climbs on. Aperture 140–170 (closer = less blur). |
| Climax (lamp room, 49.5–58) | Medium on the hero at the lens; after ignition, a rising pull-back to a wide of the tower (fov 30 → 40, aperture 150 → 320), focus switches from hero to lens. |
| Resolution (harbour end + title, 58–76.5) | Mirror of the opening but wider and higher (`[-22,26,44] → [-27,33,55]`, fov 42), focus 70, aperture 380, tilt band at 36 %. |

Rules: always look *down* on the world (never eye level); every camera path is a `track()` of 2–7 keys (monotone cubic, no overshoot); focus distance is recomputed each frame from camera to the hero (`post.dof.focus = cam.position.distanceTo(hero + (0,.7,0))`); in the tilt cut the sharp band follows the hero's projected screen height (`tiltCenter`, clamped .2–.8).

## Score structure

- **Voices (Kokoro via `core/tts/tts.py`)**: narrator `af_heart`, speed .82–.90 (slow, storybook); the quest-giver `bm_george`, speed .84, low-passed at 7 kHz in the mix so he sits "in the world". 7 narrated lines + 1 dialogue line, each 1–5.4 s. Check with `core/tts/asr_check.py`; put invented names in the `asr` field (`Graywater`, `Ren`, `whisper would`), otherwise whisper flags them.
- **Music**: one licensed track, edited to picture: Scott Buckley, *Precipice* (CC BY 4.0), cut by `music/edit.py` into five sections (intro pad → **0.8 s breath when the lighthouse dies** → continuous build through forest and storm → **hard stop into a reverb tail at 42.0 when the flame nearly dies**, only the intro pad under it → the composer's own build → **its D→G♭ key-change downbeat placed at 53.500 s = ignition**, located automatically by the steepest < 250 Hz onset (error < 5 ms) → jump to the final E♭ arrival for the title). All cut points are in `music/CUES.md`. Pick one piece whose own arc matches the story; cut inside it rather than stitching tracks.
- **Ambience & foley (`mix.py`, synthesized with `core/audio/sfx.py`)**: per-set beds with crossfaded gain curves (harbour waves + rope creaks, brazier crackle, forest crickets + leaves, storm rain + wind with a gust swell), and events: lamp-out "fwoomp" 12.3, match strike 16.15, UI chime on the dialogue box 17.3, footsteps from `sfx_events.json` (wood / dirt / stone), thunder 0.25 s after each flash, wind whoosh at the gust, two heartbeats in the silence, the ignition boom (42 Hz drop + air + high shimmer) at 53.5, six small bells as the ships light up.
- **Mix**: each voice line compressed and RMS-matched; buses levelled to voice −17, music −21, ambience −30, foley −27 dB RMS; music ducks ~2.2 dB under voice, then a **per-line auto-duck** pulls music + ambience to ≈10 dB under each line (only down, never up; the script prints the achieved gap per line, 7–14 dB in the demo); `tanh` soft-clip; final loudness by `core/render/mux.sh` (two-pass loudnorm −14 LUFS, TP −1.2).

## Palette & props

The demo is a night film: cold blue against warm amber fire, strong bloom, heavy vignette.

**Resolution & pixels.** Scene textures are drawn per pixel on small canvases (`PX` class, `px.js`) and uploaded with `NearestFilter`; world-space UVs (`worldUV`, `kit.js`) keep **24 px/m** on every surface. Characters are 34×50 px frames at `SPX = 1/30` m per pixel (≈1.67 m tall). Colour comes from **ramps** (3–6 swatches) chosen by brightness with a 4×4 Bayer dither; the dither band `dz` must be narrow: **.22 for characters, .45 for textures** (wider = checkerboard noise everywhere). Sprites get an automatic 1 px **selout** outline (`PX.outline(.3)`: transparent pixels next to the sprite become the neighbour colour darkened toward `#16 0e 1e`).

**Palette (night).** Sky `#050818 → #101d3e → #2c4262` (horizon), fog `#16223a` (harbour) / `#152a48` (forest) / `#1c2334` (storm), moon light `#8fa8e0`, hemisphere `#3a4c7a / #0a0a12`. Fire and windows `#ff9d4a`, `#ffae55`, `#ff8c3a`, lantern `#ffb050`, lighthouse `#fff0c8`. Cool character fill `#9fb2e8`. Hero cloak ramp `#2e0b14 … #c9503f` (crimson), scarf gold `#b08424`; keeper coat navy `#10131f … #5a6c98`, beard greys. Ink `#1a1016`.

**Materials.** Boxes and cylinders only: houses with plaster + timber beams (`plaster`), shingle roofs (`shingles`), planks with nail dots (`woodPlanks`), Worley cobbles (`cobbles`), layered rock (`rock`), bark/canopy/fern/grass/mushroom sprites (`forest_art.js`). Foliage, grass, ferns, mushrooms, distant ships and ridges are **billboards** (instanced where many). Windows are emissive pixel panes (`windowMat`, emissive 2.2). Fire is a 6-frame pixel atlas billboard at 10 fps (`fire`). Sea is a custom shader: quantized pixel ripples, crest bands, light reflection columns stretched toward the camera, sparkle glints.

**Light rig per set.** One dim shadow-casting moon (DirectionalLight 1.1–1.2, 2048 map) + hemisphere fill + **practical point lights** (windows 8, street lamps 12–14, brazier 16 with shadows, lantern 2.6–14 with shadows) + a **cool front fill** (`#9fb2e8`/`#8fa6e0`, 1.2–1.8, range 6–8 m) placed ~2 m in front of the hero. Additive `glow` sprites sit on every light source so bloom has something to grab.

**Post chain** (`post_ts.js`, `makePost(renderer, scene, camera, 1920, 1080, { ssaa: 2 })`): render at 2× (3840×2160 internal) with MSAA → physical DOF (CoC = `aper × (1/focus − 1/z)` px, 96-tap spiral gather, far samples cannot bleed over a sharp foreground) **+ tilt-shift** → UnrealBloom (strength .55, radius .75, threshold .85) → vignette/grade (amt .62, warm .1, contrast .2, sat 1.05) → ACES filmic, exposure 1.15. Tilt-shift cut adds: `tiltAmt 17`, band half-width `tiltW .075`, feather `tiltF .3` (fractions of screen height), `maxCoc ≥ 24`, saturation ×1.16, contrast .28.

**Type.** Cinzel 500/700 (chapter label, title), Cormorant Garamond italic 500 (subtitles, tagline), Cormorant 500/600 (dialogue text, name plate). Gold `#d8c28e / #e2c989 / #c9a863`, parchment white `#f3ead6 / #f6f0e2`.

Motion as built:

- **Sprites step, everything else glides.** Walk cycles use 4 frames at 6–10 fps (`['w0','w1','w2','w3'][Math.floor(t*9)%4]`), idles alternate two frames at ~1.4 Hz, blinks every few seconds, poses swap instantly (`upE → up → idle`). Camera, lights, particles, beams and focus update every frame at 60 fps.
- **Poses are data**: a frame is a parameter object (`{ step, arm:'low'|'fwd'|'up'|'hug'|'pour', kneel, lit, bob, hem, scarf, blink, closed, look }`) drawn by `drawWren` / `drawKeeper`. Add a pose by adding a table entry (or pass `extra` to `makeChar`).
- **The light breathes**: `flick(t, seed)` (three summed sines, ±20 %) on every flame; the lantern's `lit` value (0–1) redraws the flame size in the sprite *and* drives the point light (`intensity ∝ lit^1.3`), glow opacity and scale.
- **Events are timestamps** in `story.js` `T` (lighthouse flicker 11.5 → out 12.35, taper 16.2, gust 40.6, dim 41.3, dark 42.0, relight 45.6, stand 47.6, pour 52.6, ignite 53.5, beams 54.4, ships 59.2). Scenes blend with `ss(seg(t,a,b))`.
- **Signature beats:** lighthouse flickers twice and dies; brazier taper lights the lantern and both sprites' shadows jump onto the planks; the gust shrinks the flame to an ember (sprite `lit .27`), world goes almost black, then the flame re-grows; the lens ignites with an exposure burst (`exp(-(t-53.5)/.22)`) and two beam cards start sweeping; ships' lamps pop on one every 0.7 s and drift toward the harbour.
- **Weather is procedural**: rain = wind-slanted line segments (`rain`), lightning = a scripted flash curve (`flash(t)`: 150 ms strike, dip, 60 ms re-strike, exp decay) that boosts hemisphere, a "bolt" light, sky, clouds, sea and exposure together.

## End card

- **Narration subtitles**: Cormorant Garamond italic 500, 50 px, `#f6f0e2`, centred at y = H − 88, on a soft horizontal dark band (gradient, max .38 alpha), drop shadow 10 px. Fade in .35 s before the voice, out 0.45–0.8 s after it ends. One line per voice clip.
- **Dialogue box** (for a character who speaks on screen, instead of a subtitle): 1180×210 px, bottom-centred, navy gradient `rgba(14,18,34,.86) → rgba(6,8,18,.9)`, 2 px gold border `rgba(214,190,130,.9)` + inner 1 px line, gold diamond corners; name plate (Cormorant 600 34 px) overlapping the top-left edge; body Cormorant 500 44 px, **typed out over 92 % of the voice duration**; blinking gold ▼ caret when done; slides up 14 px on entry. A soft chime marks it.
- **Chapter card** (0–5.5 s): radial navy background `#11172a → #020308`, `CHAPTER  I` (Cinzel 500 34 px, 10 px tracking, `#d8c28e`) over a gold ornament line with diamond, then the chapter name in Cormorant italic 78 px with a warm glow; one pixel ember drifts across.
- **Title** (67.4–76.4 s): screen dimmed 50 %, `THE LAMPBEARER` in Cinzel 700 118 px, 14 px tracking, vertical gold gradient `#fff3cf → #e2c27c → #a8803e` with glow; ornament; tagline in Cormorant italic 50 px; music/voice credit at the bottom (24 px, 75 % alpha).
- **End credit line (library rule)**: every film ends with **"LemoLab × Claude Opus 5.5"**. In the demo it is part of the title card (`ui.js` `title()`, on by default): Cinzel 500 30 px, `#d8c28e` at 85 % alpha, 4 px tracking, centred at y = 668, fading in 70.6–71.6 s, between the tagline and the music credit, which it does not replace. `?nocredit=1` hides it (reproduces the pre-sign-off `hd-2d_v1.mp4`). Draw it the same way in a new film.
- **End credit line (this library's demo only)**: our demo ends with **"LemoLab × Claude Opus 5.5"**. It is part of the title card (`ui.js` `title()`, on by default): Cinzel 500 30 px, `#d8c28e` at 85 % alpha, 4 px tracking, centred at y = 668, fading in 70.6–71.6 s, between the tagline and the music credit, which it does not replace. `?nocredit=1` hides it (reproduces the pre-sign-off `hd-2d_v1.mp4`). This sign-off belongs to this library's demo only; a user's film carries no LemoLab credit and no copy of this card — when you adapt `ui.js`, delete the credit line.
- Export the `.srt` from the same data (`tools/srt.py`: story.js `VO` + `voices/dur.json`, +0.5 s hold, dialogue prefixed `OLD KEEPER:`).

`?tilt=1` is what makes the tilt-shift cut: it is a **render-time post effect** inside `post_ts.js` (not a second pass over a finished video). Without it you get the plain DOF version. Other page switches: `ss=1` (no supersampling, faster previews), `only=harbor|forest|cliff` (build one set), `nobloom`, `nodof`, `noglow`, `nocredit=1` (hide the end credit line).

**Partial re-render** (e.g. after changing the title card; this is how the end credit was added to the shipped film): render only the tail and splice it onto the existing `out/video_tilt.mp4` (frames 0–4019 are untouched by title-card changes), then mux again. Back up the current film first (`hd-2d_v1.mp4`). Audio is untouched (same `mix.wav` → bit-identical decoded audio).
```sh
node $D/tools/render_range.mjs 67 76.5 --workers 2 --q tilt=1 --out $D/out/tail.mp4          # 570 frames ≈ 15 s

```

When you change the story: edit `story.js` first, then copy the voice start times into `vo_times.json` (mix.py reads that file, not story.js), keep `sfx_events.json` footsteps in step with the sets' walk frames, and move the cue constants at the top of `music/edit.py` (`T_CAESURA`, `T_SILENCE`, `T_HIT`, `NARRATION`).

Pitfalls as we hit them, with the demo's props and numbers:

- **Checkerboard everywhere**: a wide dither band on ramps. Keep `dz` ≈ .22 on sprites, ≈ .45 on textures.
- **The lantern blows out the sprite**: a point light sitting on the billboard plane saturates it. Put the light **0.42–0.45 m from the lantern toward the camera** (`lp + toCam * .45`), and in the forest cap sprite lighting in the shader (`outgoingLight = min(outgoingLight, diffuseColor.rgb * 1.35 + emissive)` via `onBeforeCompile`).
- **Lights behind a billboard don't light it** (it only has a front normal). Always add a cool front fill light ~2 m in front of the hero.
- **Cylinder light beams facing the camera produced NaN**; bloom spread them into large black blocks. Use `beamCard` (an axis-aligned billboard strip that fades as it turns toward the camera) and let the glow sprite take over (`face` factor enlarges the lighthouse glow).
- **Sea reflection column division by zero**: clamp the width with `max(.35, …)`.
- **Storm too dark to read** in the first pass. Add a "readability" fill outside the story-dark beat: hemisphere +1.0, sun +1.3, sky +.35 (the `ext` term in `cliff.js`), i.e. roughly ×2–2.5 on environment mid-tones, and let it drop to nothing only during the flame-almost-out beat.
- **Distant ship glows hidden by fog/geometry**: `depthTest = false` + `renderOrder 5` on those glow sprites.
- **Tilt-shift on shots with no character**: the tracker has nothing to follow; use fixed band heights per shot (`TILT_C`).
- **Tilt-shift and occlusion**: the tilt blur is folded into the same signed CoC as depth DOF (above the band = far, below = near) so the gather keeps the "far can't bleed over sharp near" rule; don't add it as a separate blur pass.
- **Near-identical frames diverge around a flash**: the ignition burst decays with a 0.22 s time constant, so a still at 53.8 s differs visibly from the neighbouring 60 fps frame. That is expected, not a bug.
- **Node render scripts may not exit** after `done` because the static server keeps connections alive (`demo/tools/render_range.mjs` ends with `process.exit(0)` for that reason). The output file is complete once `done` is printed.

## Engine reference

### Page contract (`main.js`)
`window.render(t)` picks the shot (`shotAt(t)`), maps it to a set (`SET_OF`), points the DOF pass at that set's scene, resets post defaults (bloom .55/.85, exposure 1.15, warm .1, sat 1.05, vignette .62), calls `set.update(t, shot, camera, post, renderer)`, applies tilt-shift if `?tilt`, renders the composer, then draws the overlay (`drawOverlay(t, shot)`). One `PerspectiveCamera(32, 16/9, .3, 2000)` is shared by all sets; each set sets fov/position/lookAt every frame.
