# Dark Tech Keynote — our demo

One example among many. Don't reuse its story, arc, shots, props or timings.

Demo: *Room to Think* (42 s) · `dark-keynote.mp4` · source in [`demo/`](demo/) · a launch film for **Tidy**, a fictional app that sorts your desktop, photos and inbox in one press.


## Story & structure

The brief we set ourselves: a 30–45 second launch film for a software product (topic → story, shots, sound, music, captions → finished film).

How the native moves were spent on this story:

| Native power | Story use in the demo |
|---|---|
| **UI can be generated without limit** | The problem as accumulation: notifications, files, tabs and photos spawning faster and faster, hundreds of them (264 elements). |
| **The snap grid** | The whole product promise as one motion: everything flies into a grid in one beat. The grid stayed invisible until that moment. |
| **The cursor is the only thing alive on a screen** | The cursor is the protagonist. It blinks on the beat, gets shoved by interruptions, hesitates, winds up and presses. It is also the Tidy brand mark, so the reveal pays off twice. |
| **Screens can pause** | Everything freezes mid-air and the sound cuts to digital silence. |
| **Dark stage + soft light** | The product is revealed by a band of light sweeping across it. |
| **Numbers roll out of glyph noise** | The one stat ("0.8") gets its own screen and scrambles into place digit by digit, one digit per sixteenth note. |

**Arc:** calm hook (a cursor types the title in silence) → interruption (first notification at 3 s) → accumulation in one continuous pull-back (each bar adds a layer) → overload inserts → **freeze + silence** → **the one action** (all layers realign into one chord) → light reveal of the product → the big number → a breath where the UI puts itself away and the music subtracts itself → echo (the cursor finishes the sentence it started).

**The core directing idea — sound and picture share one timeline.** Every UI element spawns *on a note* of the score. Two marimbas play the same 12-note pattern; the second slowly speeds up and drifts out of phase. Files and photos appear on the on-grid line, notifications on the drifting line, so the visual chaos *is* the audible phasing. At the press both lines realign into one chord. We wrote the note table first (`timeline.js`), then let the picture read it.

The recipe we followed for this topic: pick the one verb the product does (here: sort). Show its absence as generated UI noise tied to a phasing score. Give the cursor the action. Reveal with light. One number. Put everything away. End on the smallest thing on an empty screen. This is one route, not the style's shape.

## Shots

| Beat | Camera |
|---|---|
| Hook | Locked extreme close-up of the cursor and one line of text (text ~150 px). Barely perceptible push (×1.04). |
| Accumulation | **One continuous pull-back** from ×5 to ×1 over 4 bars, keyed per bar in log space with monotone interpolation (one "notch" per bar, continuous velocity). Foreground cards pass the lens blurred. From 10.5 s a 1–2° dutch angle and a handheld wobble build. |
| Overload | Three half-second **inserts**, each expanding out of its source position (UI expand transition): 999+ badge / 148 thin tabs / red storage bar. |
| Freeze | Silent push-in through the frozen mess onto the cursor (×0.8 → ×2.6, ease-in-out). |
| Press | **Whip pull-out** in one beat (×2.6 → ×0.78, cubic ease-out) so the audience sees both the press point and the whole grid landing. |
| Reveal | The window turns in from a 3/4 angle (−24° → 0°) over 4.5 s while light sweeps across. The camera barely moves: only light and product move. |
| Number | Dive into the status bar counter (log-zoom to ×16), then match cut to the full-screen number. Back out the same way. |
| Breath | Slow push (×1.08) while the UI puts itself away. |
| Echo | The exact framing of the first shot. The cursor sits in the same pixel. |

Every shot change is a UI expand / collapse; no fades, no blank frames.

### Motion numbers used in the demo

- **Spawn motions** (mess section): files drop 34 px with a 6 px bounce (0.22 s), photos fling in from off-screen with rotation (0.3 s), notifications slide 90 px from the right (0.24 s), windows pop 0.94 → 1.0 (0.22 s). Everything trembles ±2.4 px in the last second before the freeze.
- **The collapse (signature move of this demo)**: a ring expands from the cursor at 2600 px/s. As the ring front passes, each element launches **towards its own type's row** (files → Desktop rows, photos → Photos rows, notifications → Inbox rows) along a curved path; each type bends the same way, so the screen shows **three coloured streams**. Within a group, rows are filled by the elements' y order and x order, so paths don't cross. Flights last 0.26–0.40 s depending on distance, morph into uniform tiles in the first third, overshoot along their final tangent and settle. Light trails in the stream colour, 9 segments, additive. Grid slot outlines light up in the accent just behind the ring front.
- **Cursor acting**: blink = 0.5 s on / 0.5 s off (it is the metronome). Interrupted: 8 px shove + 10 % squash, 0.25 s decaying wobble, then it stays solid ("frozen"). Wind-up: height ×1.35, width ×0.8, ease-in over 12 frames (≥ 8). Press: 2 frames at height ×0.3, width ×2.4. Follow-through: spring back with overshoot over 0.6 s.
- **Light reveal**: the lit area trails the front by 700 px, a 360 px soft glint rides the front at 20 %, unlit areas stay at 7 %. It takes 1.3 s.
- **Number scramble**: glyphs cycle at 24 fps with a 3-copy vertical smear; digits lock right to left on sixteenth notes, each drops in with a small damped bounce.
- **Put-away**: one element retracts per beat (sidebar, status bar, title bar, headers), then the window rim lights in the accent, then the window collapses vertically like a CRT switching off (ease-in, 0.22 s) and shrinks into the cursor.

## Score structure

- **Music first**: `timeline.js` holds the tempo grid (**120 BPM**), the 12-note pattern and the note tables of all voices (phasing is computed there as a time warp). The picture spawns elements from the same tables. `tools/cuecheck.py` checks the key cues and that every spawned element sits on a score note.
- **Score (original, minimalist)**: marimba (voice 1, on grid) + hard-mallet vibraphone (voice 2, unison, then phasing ahead; slightly detuned and brighter at the peak) + glockenspiel (voice 3, drifting the other way) + a numpy pad (A drone that gains G#/D# dissonance and rises) + a low sine pulse (eighths → sixteenths) + a quiet noise shaker. At the press all voices land on **one A major 9 chord**, the bowed vibraphone carries it into the reveal (L-cut), then one clean pattern plays, and in the breath the pattern subtracts notes bar by bar until one quarter note is left. Samples: VCSL (CC0).
- **Sound families**: the mess sounds are scattered (every notification pitched ±45 cents off, random pans, a different timbre per source). Tidy's sounds are one family: felt ticks and glass taps, all in A major pentatonic, centred. The 264 landing taps form one in-key shimmer.
- **Layers**: ambience (quiet room + computer fan and a 6.8 kHz coil whine that grow through the mess, **held back until the last voice-over line ends**), foley (cursor tick, low-profile keys, return, notification glass, file plop, photo flick, window whoosh, glitch accents, storage buzz, stacking thumps, the press "doom" = felt mallet + 55→40 Hz sine drop, grid tick, felt ticks, light-sweep shimmer, digit grains, CRT-off), music.
- **Silences**: 15.0–16.0 s is **digital zero on every track** (the screen paused); the first sound after it is the press. 33.0–34.0 s is near-silence (−60 dB room); the first sound after it is the cursor tick, the same sound as frame 1.
- **J / L cuts**: a muffled crowd of notifications fades in under the close-up before the pull-back (J); the press chord rings into the reveal (L); the light shimmer starts 0.4 s before the light (J); the number chord rings into the breath (L).
- **Voice**: Kokoro `af_kore`, speed 0.95, confident and restrained: short declaratives. Music ducks −8 dB and foley −4 dB under voice.

## Palette & props

**Stage**: base `#0A0B0F`, radial lift to `#151822` at the upper centre, one large cool glow `#3B4CCA` at 8 % in the upper right, vignette 50–55 % at the corners. Hairline grid `rgba(255,255,255,.032)` every 48 px with every 4th line at `.06`. Grain: none (`mux.sh` grain 0).

| Role | Value |
|---|---|
| Window surface / raised / raised-2 | `#12151C` / `#1A1E28` / `#222734` |
| Border / inner top highlight | `rgba(255,255,255,.08)` / `rgba(255,255,255,.07)` (1 px) |
| Text / secondary / label | `#E8EAF0` / `#8A90A0` / `#5C6272` |
| **Brand accent (the one colour)** | lime `#B7F34A`, glow `rgba(183,243,74,.35)` — the cursor, the "Tidy up" pill, the checkmarks, "0.8" |
| Noise red (problem section only) | `#FF5A5F` badges. After the press, no red ever appears again |
| Three flow colours (collapse trails) | files `#C9D3E6`, photos `#F2A65A`, notifications `#7E95FF` |

**Props**: the Tidy brand mark (squircle + cursor) and wordmark; windows (radius 14, 40 px title bar); notification cards with "now"; folded-corner file icons with mono filenames (`final_FINAL_2.pdf`, `Untitled 38.txt`); procedural landscape photo thumbnails; inbox rows with unread dots; a tab strip that keeps splitting (148 tabs); a 999+ badge; a red storage bar; uniform snap tiles (60–64 px, radius 20 %). Product shots rotate up to 24°.

**Captions as used**: toast `rgba(12,14,19,.72)` pill (`.88` during the mess), 1 px `rgba(255,255,255,.09)` border, Inter 500 40 px `#E8EAF0`, 8 px accent dot, 12 px rise + fade in 0.16 s. The title and final line are typed by the cursor in frame (only in the .srt). The product window is lifted 25 px while captions are up.

## End card

**Title card** = the cursor typing the film title in the close-up, with a small mono overline `TIDY · A LAUNCH FILM`. **End card** = the typed tagline plus, left-aligned beneath it: film title, "a launch film for Tidy, a fictional app", style name, `Lemo-Opuscar`, `LemoLab × Claude Opus 5.5`, credits. Then everything fades except the cursor, which blinks twice and goes out.

The "LemoLab × Claude Opus 5.5" sign-off belongs to this library's demo only; a user's film carries no LemoLab credit and no copy of this card.

## Rights

Tidy is fictional. Every interface element is original and drawn in code; no real OS chrome, app layout, font, logo or melody from the reference films is used. Samples: VCSL (CC0); fonts OFL (see `demo/CREDITS`).

## Build notes

```
styles/dark-keynote/demo/
  engine.js     the style engine (see Engine reference)   timeline.js  tempo grid + pattern + phasing note tables + key times
  world.js      the mess: 264 elements generated from the note tables, spawn poses, freeze, type-row snap targets
  film.js       scenes: mess / inserts / collapse / product reveal / number / breath / echo, captions, event list
  frames.js     engine demo scene          main.js / index.html   page (window.render(t), window.EV)
  music/score.py   original score (sub-agent), stems, score.json      mix.py   foley + voices + ducking + silences
  tools/        dump_timeline.mjs export.mjs cuecheck.py
```
1. Write `timeline.js` (grid, pattern, voices, key times) → `node tools/dump_timeline.mjs` → hand `timeline.json` + the cue map to a music sub-agent. Draw in parallel.
2. Build the engine and the product window first (they are the style frames), then the mess generator from the note tables, then the collapse.
3. `sh demo/build.sh` rebuilds everything: TTS → whisper → score → events → cue check → mix → srt → render → mux (−14 LUFS, grain 0).
4. Review with `node core/render/still.mjs demo --range 0.5:42:1` + `sheet.py` at least twice, plus frame strips of the collapse and the press.

Pitfalls tied to this demo's props:
- Nearest-slot snapping of the 264 elements looked like a flicker; sending each type to its own rows (Desktop / Photos / Inbox) along curved paths with trails fixed it.
- The first generator left holes in the grid; we trimmed or padded each group to exactly its slot count.
- The "window closes" first used a flat tinted rectangle; the real window is now squashed and tinted only in the last 45 %.
- Fan and coil whine (300 Hz–7 kHz) masked the voice; they are held down until the last line of the section ends.
- Caption toasts clipped the bottom of the product window; the product is lifted 25 px while captions are up.

## Engine reference

`demo/engine.js` is a plain ES module (Canvas 2D, no dependencies besides `core/lib.js`). All drawing functions take the context first. Coordinates are in pixels of whatever transform is active.

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `setAccent(hex)` | Set the one brand colour (default `#B7F34A`). Everything accent-driven follows: cursor, toast dot, `litShape({accent:true})`, `trail`. |
| `bg(g, {lift, cool, dark})` | Near-black stage with radial lift and cool glow. |
| `grid(g, {ox, oy, scale, module, alpha, rect})` | Hairline grid that can follow a camera. |
| `glow(g, x, y, r, color, a)` · `vignette(g, a)` | Soft light pools, corner falloff. |
| `panel(g, x, y, w, h, {r, fill, shadow, cheap})` | Rounded UI surface: soft shadow, top-lit fill, 1 px border, inner highlight. `cheap` = offset shadow for hundreds of items. |
| `litShape(g, path2d, {accent, color, glowR, sweep, bbox})` | **Draw any shape in this style**: dark lit surface with rim light, or (with `accent`) a glowing accent fill; `sweep` 0..1 adds a moving light band. |
| `sparklePath(cx, cy, r, k, rot)` | A four-point star path (for sparkles, "new" marks). |
| `trail(g, pts, {color, width, caretH})` | A fading light trail along points, optionally ending in a cursor. |
| `caret(g, x, y, h, {sx, sy, on, glow, color})` | The cursor with squash/stretch and blink. |
| `tidyMark(g, x, y, s)` · `wordmark(g, x, y, px)` | Brand mark (squircle + cursor) and word + cursor. Rename for your product. |
| `windowBox` / `windowContent(kind)` / `notif` / `fileIcon` / `photo` / `badge` / `appIcon` / `storageBar` | The UI kit. `windowContent` kinds: note, inbox, browser, sheet, chat, viewer, code. |
| `flyPose(from, to, p)` · `motionBlur(p, span, n, draw)` | Snap flight with overshoot, spring rotation and morph; multi-sample motion blur. |
| `lightReveal(g, src, x, y, w, h, p, {base, soft, band, glint, angle})` | Light-sweep reveal of any canvas. |
| `perspective(g, src, cx, cy, w, h, rotY, {slices})` | Strip-rendered Y-rotation of a flat canvas; returns `map(u,v)` to screen. |
| `scramble(g, text, x, y, t, locks, {px, fam, color, tracking})` | Glyph-noise-to-number roll with per-character lock times. |
| `toast(g, text, a, {dense})` | The caption component. |
| `camera({x, y, zoom, rot, sx, sy})` | 2.5D camera: `.apply(g, z)` transforms to depth z; `.proj(x, y, z)` returns screen position and scale. |
| `buf(name, w, h)` · `rr(g, …)` · `font(px, wt, fam)` · `rgba` · `mix` | Helpers. |

**Minimal example: a warm orange four-point spark with a cursor tail, in this style.**
```js
import * as E from './engine.js';
const g = document.querySelector('canvas').getContext('2d');
E.setAccent('#D97757');                       // the one colour
E.bg(g); E.grid(g, { ox: 960, oy: 540 });
const pts = []; for (let i = 0; i <= 40; i++) { const u = i / 40; pts.push([360 + u * 1100, 640 - Math.sin(u * Math.PI) * 260]); }
E.trail(g, pts, { width: 8 });                // the cursor's path as a fading light trail
E.litShape(g, E.sparklePath(1480, 380, 90, 0.2), { accent: true, glowR: 40, bbox: [1390, 290, 180, 180] });
E.caret(g, 1560, 380, 120);                   // a cursor riding the spark
const card = new Path2D(); card.roundRect(300, 200, 420, 160, 28);
E.litShape(g, card, { sweep: 0.5, bbox: [300, 200, 420, 160] });   // any shape as a lit dark UI surface
E.vignette(g);
```
Render it with `?scene=engineDemo` (see `frames.js`). To keep a single element in colour in an otherwise neutral frame, draw everything with default `litShape` and only that element with `{accent: true}`.
