Demo: *Five Rules for a Poster* (44 s) · `swiss-motion.mp4` · source in [`demo/`](demo/)


A 30–60 second film: five rules build one concert poster on a grid; a red circle breaks the grid, and the poster turns out to be the score of the music. The demo sets Archivo as its one family.

## Story & structure

Pure 2D graphic design animated on a grid: flat white paper, black type and bars, a very light grey and **one** saturated red. It is the language of 1950s–70s Zurich concert posters (Müller-Brockmann, Hofmann, Gerstner, Crouwel) turned into motion the way modern identity systems move (Experimental Jetset, Pentagram): **every element snaps to the grid, every move lands on a beat, nothing bounces**.

The charm is **rigor with one exception**. The whole frame obeys a system, so the one element that doesn't obey it becomes a character.

Never copy a specific historical poster's composition (no concentric-circle or fan compositions lifted from Müller-Brockmann). Don't use Helvetica or Akzidenz font files. Pick an OFL neo-grotesque (Archivo, Inter, Schibsted Grotesk, Instrument Sans…). Never name a real institution on a poster.

Pick stories where **the system itself tells the story**. The demo used all five native powers, the strongest (the grid means something) at the peak:

| Native power | Story use |
|---|---|
| **The modular grid** | The grid is the stage and the rulebook. Show it being built (lines draw on the beat), show it briefly in section gaps, and at the peak **make the grid mean something**: in the demo, 7 columns = the 7 notes of A dorian and 16 rows = 16 eighth notes, so the poster *is* the score. |
| **Snap = beat** | Every element's arrival is a percussion hit: type clack, knife, ruling pen. Picture and music share one coordinate system, not a sync pass after the fact. |
| **Rules generate design (programme)** | The plot is a set of rules applied one by one to one artifact. End by showing the same programme generating many artifacts (the Gerstner reveal). |
| **Extreme scale contrast** | A 700 px numeral next to 19 px technical notes. The giant element is the chapter card, the tiny one is texture. |
| **One signal colour** | Only one thing is red, so red = the protagonist. When it breaks a rule it is the only thing on screen that is not exact. |

**Adapting any topic:** turn it into **a system plus one exception**. A product launch: the product's spec sheet assembles on a grid, then one feature breaks out of it. A company's history: each decade is a rule added to one poster. A love story: two red elements on two different grids, and the film ends when one of them leaves its grid.

**Emotional arc (30–60s):** order being built (curious, crisp) → order complete (correct and a bit dull, *say it*) → hesitation (the red element twitches and snaps back) → the break (the only non-snapped, linear move in the film; drums drop out) → everything else re-flows around it, better (full band back) → the reveal (the grid means something) → scale reveal (same system, many outputs) → back to the hero artifact on the end card.

## Shots

The "camera" is a 2D matrix (centre, scale, rotation). It moves only with the precise ease and only on beats.

| Beat | Camera |
|---|---|
| Opening | Locked full frame. One gesture: a red line strikes across and the grid columns grow out of it on sixteenths |
| Building (rules) | Locked spread, so the viewer reads cause (rule, left) → effect (artifact, right) |
| The break | Left page slides out, artifact moves to centre-left, grid lines extend across the whole frame (the grid is bigger than the page) |
| Reveal | **Rotate the artifact 90° in 1.5 beats and stop.** Only then do labels (note names, bar numbers) wipe in, then the playhead sweeps two bars. Each bar turns red on the exact frame of its onset: put onsets on whole frames (multiples of 0.25 s at 24 fps) |
| Scale reveal | Rotate back while pulling out to a wall of artifacts from the same system |
| Ending | The red line strikes again and cuts the other artifacts away. Push back to the opening spread, end card on the left page, hero artifact on the right |

- **Two curves only.** Precise ease `cubic-bezier(.7,0,.2,1)` for snaps, linear for lines being drawn, the playhead and the rule-breaker. No overshoot, no spring, no bounce.
- **Durations are note values** at the film's BPM (120: 1/8 = 0.25 s, 1/16 = 0.125 s). A snap starts one note value early and **lands on the beat**.
- **Entrances are wipes or clip-reveals, never fades.** Words rise out of a clip rect from below the baseline (1/16 note) and leave upward (1/8 note). Lines grow along their length. Paper appears by a vertical wipe. Big numerals climb in **4 eased steps** ("one module at a time").
- **Deletions are knife cuts.** A 2 px line crosses the element in 1/16, then the element collapses vertically to its midline in 1/8.
- **Ripples are ordered by distance** from the cause. After the red circle lands, units re-flow two at a time on sixteenths, nearest first.
- **The exception moves differently.** It is linear, not snapped, and pauses for one eighth mid-flight (a glance back). It grows as it travels. A coordinate readout next to it turns from `col 5.00 row 0.00 · on grid` to red `off grid` with non-integer (even negative) values.
- Everything renders at a smooth 24 fps. There's no stepping: this style is digital precision, not hand-made.

## Score structure

- **Music**: Motorik / krautrock, 120 BPM, A dorian (not a generic piano-and-strings bed). Layer one instrument per rule:
  1. hats only;
  2. + full motorik kit (`drum_kit`: kick 1, 3, 3&; snare 2, 4; closed hat eighths);
  3. + `electric_bass` eighth-note root pulse;
  4. + numpy saw arpeggio sixteenths with an opening filter;
  5. + `glockenspiel` doubled by a soft numpy square lead.

  **Drop the drums for the one bar of the break**, return on the landing. Before the reveal add one bar of near-silence (bass pedal + quarter-note tick). During the reveal keep only kick + bass + melody so every note is audible.
- **The melody comes from the same JSON as the picture** (`score.json`: column → pitch, row → onset, length → duration). "The poster is the score" is true in code, not faked.
- **Foley follows materials**, dry and close, no reverb:
  - letterpress clack (metal transient + 3.3 / 5.1 kHz resonances + wooden tray);
  - ruling pen "tss";
  - guillotine (band-pass sweep + metal snick);
  - paper slap / slide;
  - numeral "thunk" per step;
  - block snap;
  - circle landing (58 Hz felt thump).

  The rule-breaker is the only element that *sings*: a sine glide that follows its position.
- **Voice**: cool, crisp female narrator, Kokoro `af_sarah` at speed 1.0. It had ~7× the 3–8 kHz consonant energy of `af_kore`. Keep lines rule-like: "Rule one. Build a grid." Check every line with whisper (write numbers as `"asr": "Rule 1, …"`).
- **Mix**: voice compressed, music ducked ~−10 dB under voice (voice ≥ 6 dB above music), −14 LUFS.

## Palette & props

- **Frame grid**: 1920×1080, 12 columns, 96 px side margins, 24 px gutters (122 px columns), 24 px baseline. Treat the frame as a **spread**: left page (cols 1–6) = the "programme" (numeral, rule text, notes); right page (cols 8–12) = the artifact (poster 706×1008, ratio 0.70 ≈ Swiss world format).
- **Artifact grid**: derive it from the content (Gerstner). In the demo the poster has 7 columns × 91 px and 16 rows × 40 px, with a 26 px baseline grid in the text zone. I first tried 12 semitone columns: bars were only 43 px wide and the poster looked like a data chart. **Choose module sizes that give the bars mass.**
- **Palette**: page `#EAE9E5`, paper `#FFFFFF`, ink `#111111`, signal red `#E30613`, grid lines `#CFCEC9` on the page / `#C9C8C2` while building / `#E2E1DC` on paper, secondary bars `#CFCEC9`. No gradients, no shadows, no particles, no grain (mux grain 0).
- **Type**: one family for the whole film (demo: **Archivo** variable, weights 400–800). Letter-spacing −2.2% at ≥ 90 px. Lowercase headlines (`neue musik`). Rule numerals at ~980 px (700 px figure height), bottom-aligned with the poster's bottom edge, **optically** flush left (subtract the glyph's left bearing). Notes 19 px Medium. Always `document.fonts.load` every weight before drawing.
- **Composition**: flush left, ragged right. Everything on a grid line. Big white spaces are part of the layout. The final composition must be **visibly bolder** than the "correct" one:
  - one main diagonal with a strong long-short rhythm;
  - the red element at ~2× scale;
  - elements **bleeding** off the paper edge;
  - type overprinting the red circle (black on red).
  Merely tilting the correct layout is not enough.
- **Bars as notes**: bar width = column minus 8 px; consecutive cells of one note merge into one bar (overdraw 1 px at the seams or antialiasing shows hairlines, especially when rotated).
- **The secondary voice** (bass) is light-grey bars under the black ones. They read as a shadow diagonal and give depth without a second colour.

## Titles, subtitles & end card

- **Subtitles are part of the layout**, not a bar at the bottom. Each line sits at column 1 on the spread's left page: the first sentence as a 30 px Medium grey lead-in, the rest as a 76 px Bold statement. Each word clip-reveals on its whisper timestamp. Non-rule lines use Regular weight ("Perfect. And a little dull."). In other shots the line sits at column 1 of that shot, at the artifact's headline baseline or under the wall like a museum label.
- **Title card**: `Five Rules / for a Poster`, 120 px Bold, two lines flush left, sitting on the opening red line. A 19 px caption row with a 1 px rule above it (`A programme in five steps · 1961 · ♩ = 120`).
- **Caption row + notes**: top of the left page (title / `Rule 0n / 05` / keyword); bottom of column 5: 2–3 technical notes per rule (`Columns 7 · Rows 16 · Module 91 × 40`). Bottom of column 7: a bar counter `bar 04.3`.
- **End card**: the opening spread again. `Swiss Motion / Graphics` 120 px, red line under it, `LemoLab × Claude Opus 5.5` 36 px, notes at the bottom, hero poster on the right. The LemoLab sign-off belongs to this library's demo only: a user's film carries no LemoLab credit and no copy of this card.

## Pitfalls we hit (demo record)

- **12 columns looked like a chart.** Grid modules must give the graphic elements mass. We used fewer, wider columns for the artifact and kept the standard 12 columns for the frame.
- **The "better" composition wasn't obviously better.** Four small staircases → one scattered layout wasn't convincing. Fix: one main diagonal with long/short rhythm, 2× red element, bleeds, type over red.
- **Rotation reveal needs a stop.** Rotating and labelling at the same time read as noise. Order it: rotate (1.5 beats) → hold → grid lines → labels → playhead → sweep.
- **Merged bars showed seams** after rotation and scaling (antialiasing between adjacent rects). Overdraw 1 px where cells join.
- **Labels overlapping the header**: hide the caption row before the rotated shot.
- **Word timings**: whisper splits or merges words ("type face"), and `asr_check` reports the first word at −0.6 s (padding). Align by letters and clamp to 0 (`tools/words.py`).
- **Subtitle rule** (≥ voice + 0.6 s and ≥ 1.8 s): two lines missed by 2 ms. `tools/subs.py` asserts it, so fix by nudging start times.
- **The wall cut must follow the line**: shrink the wall board from the side the red line enters, in screen space.
- The other posters on the wall share the camera matrix, so draw them **only** during the wall shot. Otherwise they leak into other shots at ±786 px.
- Canvas `letterSpacing` also affects `measureText`, so compute widths after setting the font.

## Build notes

```
styles/swiss-motion/demo/
  score.json  grid = score: stiff / final melody, bass, circle, bleeds, timeline
  ease.js     cubic-bezier(.7,0,.2,1), snap(t, t_arrive, dur), steps(), track()
  film.js     layout system, rules, poster, circle, reveal, wall, end card, foley events
  main.js     loads fonts, score, lines, whisper word times; ?nosub=1, ?poster=1
  lines.json  voice script (af_sarah)          tools/words.py  word timings → subtitle reveal
  music/score.py  motorik score from score.json   mix.py  foley + ducked voice + music
  tools/subs.py   subtitle intervals (asserted) → srt     build.sh  one-shot rebuild
```

1. Design the layout system first: frame grid, artifact grid, what columns and rows *mean*. Write `score.json`.
2. `node core/render/still.mjs styles/swiss-motion/demo --range 0.5:43.5:1 --out …` then `sheet.py`. Review a 1 s overview plus dense 0.25 s strips around the break and each transition.
3. `tts.py` → `asr_check.py` (0 mismatches) → `tools/words.py`.
4. `music/score.py` (onsets from `score.json`; check sweep onsets ≤ 5 ms) → `events.mjs` → `mix.py` (prints voice/music/foley dB per line).
5. `video.mjs --workers 3` (1056 frames in ~12 s) → `mux.sh … 24 0`. Or simply `sh styles/swiss-motion/demo/build.sh` (~55 s from zero).
