## Story & structure

A just-woken diner mug tastes itself: bitter! It chases a runaway sugar cube around the kitchen (counter, china cabinet, sink). When the cube is about to be sucked down the drain, the mug stretches its rubber-hose arm around the whirlpool and fishes it out, then sadly lets it go; the cube jumps into the mug by itself. The coffee turns sweet and the whole kitchen dances with the band. A 1930s radio sports announcer calls the chase like a horse race ("And they're off!").

Arc (40–55 s): hook on frame 1 (bouncing title letters, band hit) → a small want → a chase in 3 escalating set pieces, one visual gag each → danger → the stretch → dead silence → a quiet, kind turn → release: the whole world dances → iris out with a gag. One hero, one goal, one turn.

The old guide asked for at least three of the four native powers with the strongest at the peak, and suggested adapting any topic as **a chase or a performance inside one lively location** (a kitchen, an office, a toy shop, a factory) with a supporting cast of 5–8 living objects. That was this demo's shape, not a rule of the style.

Native moves spent:
- **Everything breathes on the beat**: the kitchen is a character; at the climax the whole world dances in sync, walls included (the payoff shot).
- **Mickey-mousing**: a stair of plates is a xylophone; the small character climbs it on rising xylophone eighths, the big one on tuba quarters.
- **Rubber-hose stretch**: the turning point; the mug's arm stretches around a whirlpool and down a drain in one unbroken shot.
- **The film is a physical object**: the title card rolls up like a window shade; a character's glove pulls the iris shut.

## Shots

| Beat | Camera |
|---|---|
| Opening | Title card with rotating sunburst; letters hop in a wave each beat; the card rolls up like a window shade to reveal the set |
| Establishing | **Stage-wide, locked off**, eye level. The set reads like a proscenium; props lined along the counter |
| Reaction gag | Hard cut to a close-up of the face (the only big face shot early on) |
| Chase | **Trucking pan** alongside the runners, eased start and stop; the destination prop enters frame before the gag |
| Vertical set piece | Not the whole set piece far away: each climber followed in a **medium shot** (character ≈ 1/4–1/3 of frame height) so each musical step and the plate's bounce reads; cut between climbers; then tilt down with the fall |
| Danger | Slightly high angle so the hazard reads at a glance; **one unbroken shot** through the big stretch |
| Quiet turn | Medium two-shot, then the hero's **back** walking away small in the background while the other character is big in the foreground (on a foreground counter piece) |
| Climax | Pull back from a close-up to a **medium-full** shot (not a far wide: faces must read): hero in the middle, living props on the counter behind, and a **foreground row of bigger dancers** on a nearer counter piece. 2–3 steps by bar (sway → kicks → group squat-and-spring), then **everyone freezes in a ta-da pose on the last beat** and holds into the iris |
| Ending | Iris closes on the heroes; a character's glove pulls it shut |

The hesitation beat before the leap, as held-frame acting: crouch (hold) → eyes to the other character's back (hold) → eyes up to the goal (hold) → back → up + grin → small hop → leap. Each glance on an eighth note, with a woodblock tick, while the camera slowly pushes in. The music stops for a "lock eyes" beat and everything freezes, background breathing included.

## Score structure

Original big-band score (`demo/music/score.py`, VSCO 2 CE / VCSL samples via `core/audio/sampler.py`, banjo via `pluck.py`). **144 BPM, 4/4 → 1 beat = 10 frames**, 1 bar = 1.667 s, 28 bars. One original 4-bar syncopated theme, stated for the title, the chase, a slow solo-clarinet version for the tender beat, and a key-change full-band out-chorus for the climax.

Stops (hard silence including reverb tails) on the lock-eyes beat, on the suspense before a gag, and a full 2 beats of silence right after the stretch; stingers on every gag; slide whistle for every stretch / slide / fall; the xylophone *is* the plates. The projector clatter is the only sound inside the silence.

Foley specific to this film (all synthesised): porcelain = hard inharmonic partials (~2.7 / 4.2 / 6.3 kHz) + tiny transient; thick mug = lower, duller partials; sugar = high woodblock + sparse crunch; clock = 18 Hz hammer on two bells; toaster = click, eighth-note ticks, bell + spring "boing"; water = filtered noise + rising blips, drain slurp, bubble bed; rubber = sawtooth creak through a band-pass.

Voice: an old radio announcer calling the action like a horse race (Kokoro `bm_lewis`, speed 1.0), 7 short lines ("Seven a.m., folks!" … "Good night, folks!"). Chain: HP 260 Hz / LP 4.6 kHz, tanh saturation, a short room, compression. Music ducked ~8 dB under the voice. Optical pass: band-limit 110 Hz–6.2 kHz, wow 0.6 Hz, flutter 7 Hz.

## Palette & props

- Grey ramp: paper `#F1EEE6` · light `#C8C5BC` · mid `#9A978F` · dark-mid `#6B6963` · dark `#3B3A37` · ink `#0E0D0C` · character white `#FCFBF7`.
- Contrast fix (the first style frame was too flat): walls `#8C8981`, tiles `#A29F97`, cabinets `#66635D`–`#7C7972`; `contrast(1.14)` in the final composite.
- Ink outline 6 px in screen space; limbs 13 px on a 280 px character; film damage: gate weave ±1.2 px with a rare 3–6 px jump, vignette 0 → 62 % black at the corners, 3 px vertical jump on every cut, 0.55 px blur; walk bob 10 px (sad walk: steps 34, bob 4), run lean 0.24 rad.
- **The Mug** (hero): a squat diner mug, white porcelain, two thin black rings at the rim, full of black coffee (black ellipse + a white crescent highlight); face on the body, pie eyes, small black nose, big mouth; handle at the back like a little tail. Its **steam** carries the mood: lazy waves / bitter zigzag / straight-up alarm / wilted droop / heart.
- **The Sugar Cube**: a real projected 3D cube with a slight top-down view (elevation ≈ 0.26 rad), face mapped onto the front face with an affine transform.
- **Kitchen cast** (living props, all taking a breath phase): pots, a clock, a toaster, plates, curtains. Background motifs: striped wallpaper with small diamonds, square tiles, panelled cabinets, black-and-white checker floor, hanging lamp. Two cached backgrounds: kitchen; cupboard + sink.
- Deliberately not learnt from the references: no existing character (cat, girl, clown), no title-card or theme copy, no period racial caricature; the mug's whole body is the mug (no human torso, no straw, no shorts), unlike *Cuphead*'s design.

## Titles & subtitles

- Subtitles: "the announcer's title card": plate `rgba(12,11,10,.92)`, white double-rule border, dot-and-ring corner ornaments and a tiny 1930s ribbon-microphone icon; IM Fell English SC 36 px, paper white; bottom at y ≈ 986 by default, top when the action is low. Each card ≥ speech + 0.6 s.
- Title: Shrikhand, white face, 14 % ink outline, ink drop shadow down-right, letters hopping in a travelling wave on the beat over a rotating sunburst; sub-line in Limelight caps.

## End card

Same sunburst, a wavy-edged sign with "The End", the style name, `LemoLab × Claude Opus 5.5`, small credit lines at the bottom; it opens with an iris from black. The "LemoLab × Claude Opus 5.5" sign-off belongs to this library's demo only; a user's film carries no LemoLab credit and no copy of this card.

1. Write the bar grid first (`story.js`), then the cue map; score to it (a forked sub-agent can write `music/score.py` in parallel from `story.js` + the cue list).
2. Model sheets: `node demo/tools/still.mjs demo 0 --q 'mode=sheet&w=2880&h=1620' --w 2880 --h 1620`.
3. `core/tts/tts.py lines.json voices` → `core/tts/asr_check.py`.
4. Review: `core/render/still.mjs demo --range a:b:1` + `core/render/sheet.py` (two full passes), and frame strips at 1/12 s on key acting beats.
5. `node core/render/events.mjs demo` → `python music/score.py` → `python mix.py`.
6. `node core/render/video.mjs demo --fps 24 --workers 3` → `sh core/render/mux.sh out/video24.mp4 mix.wav rubber-hose.mp4 24 3` → `python demo/tools/final_asr.py rubber-hose.mp4`.

Or simply `sh styles/rubber-hose/demo/build.sh`.

Pitfalls tied to this demo:
- **Kokoro heard "bitter" as "better"** after an ellipsis (`is... bitter!`). "And boy, is this coffee bitter!" passes. Check every line with whisper; also check the final mp4 (whisper writes "7am" / "they're": normalise before comparing).
- The cube read as a tall box in pure front view: elevation ~0.26 and a slight 3/4 turn for expressions.
- A far shot of the plate-xylophone and of the dance climax (reviewer note) killed both gags; both were reshot as medium / medium-full.
- A kicking leg drawn behind the mug body was hidden by the handle: kick outward past the silhouette.
- A pot "grew" out of the mug's head at one camera position: check every shot's final frame.
- A leap arc that was too high left the frame; keep arcs inside the gate at the camera's zoom.
- `sfx`-style clips of different lengths → numpy broadcast errors. Place clips into a fixed-length buffer (`seq()` in `mix.py`).
- zsh: `echo =====` fails (`=word` expansion) and `timeout` doesn't exist on macOS.
- JS: `-x ** 6` is a syntax error; write `-(x ** 6)`.
