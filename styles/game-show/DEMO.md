# Game Show Flat — our demo

One example among many. Don't reuse its story, arc, shots, props or timings.

Demo: *AI进化节拍 · Rhythm of AI 1997 → 2026* (v3, 148.8 s, 1920×1080, 30 fps) · `game-show.mp4` · source in [`demo/`](demo/) · engine: plain SVG DOM with a pure `render(t)`, screenshotted by Playwright + Chrome Headless Shell; original score synthesized in numpy from the picture's own `events.json`.


**Language note.** All on-screen text in the demo is **Chinese** (level names, year banners, labels, the report card, the credit card). The only audio words are short **English shouts** ("Checkmate.", "Hey!", "Question!"). There is **no narration**. To make an English version, see "Switching the text to English" below.

## Story & structure

The history of AI from 1997 to 2026 staged as a **game show made of rhythm levels**. The film opens on a title set where the whole cast drops in on the beat and counts "One! Two! Three! Four!". Then comes a run of **levels**. Each level is **one bar of title card** (GAME N + name + years, flying in on a brass jingle) followed by **eight bars of play**: a pattern is set up in the first half, answered or escalated in the second, and the last beat (bar 7, beat 3) is a **slam + "Perfect!"** judgement. A **remix** level near the end piles every recent event onto one set, with a month timeline across the top and shrunken thumbnails of each finished bit parked along the bottom. The ending hatches a new character from an egg, types out a **report card** ("AI 进化史 · 成绩单") with a Superb! star, and closes on a **credit card**.

How the demo spent the native moves:

| Native power | Demo use |
|---|---|
| **Levels with years** | Chess and Go (1997–2016), quiz show (2011), attention factory (2017–2020), AI art studio (2021–2024), chat chorus (2022–2023), thinking + price war (2024–2025), agent pipeline (2025), then a 2026 remix. |
| **Call-and-response** | Human move / machine move (chess), question / buzzer (quiz), lead "Hey!" / crowd "Hey!" (chorus), task drops / stamp DONE (agents). Go stones on eighth notes after chess on quarter notes. |
| **Judgement words** | "Perfect!", "第 37 手！", "首超！", price tags getting hammered, "9.9 ✓" thought bubbles. |
| **Stats as game UI** | Podium dollar scores, a users counter racing to 1,000,000, parameter counts, price tags ($60 → $2.19), a bar chart that grows by beat. |
| **Remix / thumbnails** | One set, a month ribbon, each item gets 2 bars centre stage and then shrinks (×0.27) into a slot at the bottom. In the finale all thumbnails bounce together under a giant year. |
| **Egg → report card → credit** | A "next level" tease (NEXT egg hatches a "???" baby bot), then a typewriter recap of three lines, then the credit card. |

**Demo shape:** cold open on the cast + count-in (4 bars) → 7 levels of 9 bars (card + 8) → 1-bar REMIX card → 16-bar remix (7 items × 2 bars + 2-bar finale) → 9-bar ending (egg 2 bars, "Hi!" 1 bar, report card 3 bars, credit 3 bars incl. 0.8 s fade). Total 93 bars = 148.8 s.

How we adapted the topic: we listed the phases, gave each one *one verb that can repeat on a beat* (place, buzz, pump, splat, sing, hammer, stamp), a year range and a set colour, and picked one "Perfect!" moment per level. The topic had a crowd (many companies and products), so they became bean contestants with name tags dropping in one per beat.

## Shots

No camera travel anywhere in the demo: a frontal, symmetrical proscenium throughout. Tempo `BPM = 150`, `B = 0.4 s`, `BARL = 1.6 s`.

| Section | Bars | Camera / cut | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cold open + title | 0–3 | locked wide, punches on each count | "AI 进化节拍" 200 px, white with a 26 px ink stroke, glyphs popping 0.06 s apart; subtitle "RHYTHM OF AI · 1997 → 2026" in Fredoka; the cast drops in behind it one per half-beat, each with a pitched pip |
| Levels 1–7 | 4–66 | hard cut + 0.08 s white flash on each card bar; punches 0.008 (ticks), 0.02 (hits), 0.03–0.05 (slams) | card bar, then 8 bars of play, slam + "Perfect!" on bar 7 beat 3 |
| REMIX card + remix | 67–83 | locked wide, thumbnails shrink into bottom slots | month ribbon across the top |
| Ending | 84–92 | hard cuts on bar lines; the only fade: last 0.8 s to navy | egg → "Hi!" → report card (typewriter, one character per 1/8 beat, key click per 2 characters) → credit card |

## Score structure

- **Score (`music.py` + `synth_lib.py`)**: 150 BPM, a four-chord loop F–G–Em–Am (the J-pop "royal road", one chord per bar, `CH`), two 8-note melodies `MA` / `MB`. Instruments: tanh-shaped sine kick, band-passed noise snare and clap, hats, slap bass (`slap`, patterns funk/drive/pump/soft), detuned-saw **brass stabs** with a closing filter, square lead with vibrato, pluck (marimba), bell (music box), triangle pad, square arp, cowbell.
- Each bar gets a mode in `PLAN` (`main`, `count`, `funk`, `quiz`, `electro`, `dream`, `film`, `pop`, `popBig`, `think`, `heavy`, `agent`, `agentFast`, `fill`, `future`, `futureBig`, `egg`, `calm`, `fanfare`, `end`), one flavour per level. Level cards get a **jingle** (crash + kick + rising brass arpeggio + snare roll into the level). The 2026 remix transposes up 2 semitones.
- **Event-driven SFX**: `node render.mjs events` exports every `ev()` from the picture to `events.json` (474 events in the demo). `music.py` maps each event name to a sound: `tock`/`bleep` (chess), `stone` (Go), `ding`/`boop`/`buzz` (quiz), `land` (plop + boing), `pip` (pitched pop, uses `f`), `slam`/`bigslam`, `stamp`, `type`, `crack`/`hatch`, `servo`, `liftoff`, `swish`, `clap`, `drop`, `blip`, `kickhit`, `splat`, `denoise`, `cheer`. Unknown names are silently ignored.
- **Shouts**: `v:<name>` events play `voices/<name>.wav`. Voices are macOS `say` system voices (Samantha, Fred, Zarvox, Junior, Kathy, Ralph, Superstar) at rate 170–220, pitched up ×1.0–1.35 without changing length (`asetrate` + `atempo`, see `make_voices.sh`). Zarvox (robot) says machine lines ("Checkmate.", "Move thirty seven.", "Attention!"); Samantha/Fred are hosts. The crowd "Hey!" is six different voices stacked 5–6 ms apart and panned −0.6…+0.6 (`v:crowd`, `v:heyAll`, `v:heyBig`); `v:heyVar` picks one voice per contestant. Shouts are placed 20–30 ms *before* the beat.
- **Mix**: voices + SFX go to their own bus; the music is ducked by up to 40 % from a 12 Hz envelope of that bus; last 0.8 s fades; peak-normalize to 1.5 then `tanh` soft-clip ×0.9 → `music.wav` (44.1 kHz). `finish.sh` then applies two-pass loudnorm to **−14 LUFS / TP −1.2** and resamples to 48 kHz AAC 256k.

## Palette & props

**Canvas & line:** 1920×1080 SVG. Outline `K.ol = #1B1B1B`, width `OW = 8` px (`SO` spread: stroke, 8 px, round join and cap); 5–7 px on small parts. Hard offset shadow +10 px (banners) or +14 px (level cards).

**Palette (`K` in `main_v1.js`/`main.js`):**
| Role | Colours |
|---|---|
| Ink / paper | `ol #1B1B1B`, `white #FFFFFF`, `cream #FFF6E5` (cards, report card) |
| Candy primaries | `yellow #FFD23F`, `orange #FF8C42`, `red #FF5A5F`, `pink #FF8FB1`, `green #5BD68A`, `lime #C6F16D`, `sky #8ED1FC`, `blue #4D7CFE` |
| Deep sets | `purple #6B4FBB` / `purpleD #46318F`, `teal #3FB8AF` / `tealD #2B8F88`, `navy #26264A` (ending) |
| Props | `wood #C98A52` / `woodD #8E5530`, `gray #C3CAD9`, `chalk #2F5D50`, `skin #FFD1A8` |
| Character hues | `gpt #19B388`, `claude #D97757`, `gem1 #4E7CF6` / `gem2 #9B6CF0`, `llama #F4E9D8`, `whale #4D6BFE`, `dblue #2B59C3` |

Sets use `stripes()` (diagonal bands, often slowly scrolling), `dots()` (offset polka dots at 18–25 % white) or `raysEl()` (a rotating sunburst). Floor band at y = 860–900 with an 8 px ink line on top.

**Type:** Chinese = **Noto Sans SC 900** (`F.sans`) everywhere; Latin display = **Fredoka 700** (`F.round`: GAME N, years, "Perfect!", name tags, numbers); **ZCOOL KuaiLe** (`F.cute`) only for hand-written props. Big words use `gtext()`; title text uses `chars()`.

**Characters (`bean()` in `main_b.js`):** a rounded bean body (160 px wide, 172 px tall at scale 1), two stubby arms with white mitten hands, two foot ovals, oval eyes with a white catch-light, pink blush, a small curved mouth that swaps to an open red mouth. Identity = body colour + belly patch + **one** head mark (antenna ball, heart, "?", moon, bolt, cloud, sprout, brush, beret, captain hat, llama wool, whale spout) + an ink name-tag pill under the feet. Gemini is two half-size beans (`twins()`). Humans (`human()`) have a shirt, a round head, hair cap, optional glasses and a sweat drop. Machines of the 1990s–2010s are boxier robots (`robotDB`, `robotAG`, `robotT`, `robotW`).

**Recurring UI:**
- **Level card** (`card()`): full-bleed set colour + scrolling stripes, a cream panel (1240×460, r 50, 10 px outline, 14 px shadow), a pill tag "GAME N", the level name auto-fitted to 720 px, the years in the set colour, an icon hopping on the left.
- **Year banner** (`banner()`): top-left sticker: year in Fredoka + name + one-line subtitle, slides in from the left with a back-ease and lifts out upward.
- **Judgement** (`judge()`): 120 px Fredoka word, pink/yellow with an 18 px ink stroke, pops at −6°.
- **Burst** (`burst()`): 8-point star + expanding white ring + 8 ink speed lines, 0.3 s.

Motion numbers: `hopY(t, h)` h 8–30 px; `hitSq` 30 rad/s for 0.35 s; downbeat squash `1 - 0.1*exp(-frac(t)*16)`; `dropY` falls 500–900 px; `heyAt` 0.24 s.

**Subtitles & titles.** No burned-in subtitles: on-screen words are the telops themselves (≤ 20 CJK characters on a banner subtitle, ≤ 12 on a plate). `game-show.srt` (generated by `make_srt.py` from `events.json` + `voices/lines*.txt`) lists only the English shouts, one cue per shout, repeated crowd "Hey!"s merged.

## End card

The demo's last card carries **"LemoLab × Claude Opus 5.5"** (× is U+00D7). It is the first line of the credit card that pops in at bar 90 (144.0 s): a cream 1440×360 card (r 40, 8 px ink outline, −1.5° tilt, back-ease pop over 0.3 s) with three centred lines: `LemoLab × Claude Opus 5.5` in Fredoka 700 66 px ink (y −80), `本片由 Claude Opus 5.5 全程代码生成` in Noto Sans SC 900 60 px (y 30), `下一关：正在训练中……` 50 px in `K.claude` (y 118). It holds 4 s and fades to navy with the film. Code: the `credit` block in the ending scene of `main_b.js`. This sign-off belongs to this library's demo only; a user's film carries no LemoLab credit and no copy of this card (take the `credit` block out when reusing the code).

## Rights & facts

- **macOS system voices are licensed for personal, non-commercial use** under the macOS licence. For a commercial or public release, re-voice the shouts with Kokoro (`core/tts/`) or another cleared TTS.
- **Real brands:** the contestants stand for real AI products (GPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, Grok, Midjourney…): names only on name tags, original mascots, loose colour nods; never official logos, wordmarks or product UI. Real people (Kasparov, Lee Sedol, the KEN / BRAD podiums) appear only as generic cartoon stand-ins in factual banners.
- **Facts date fast.** The 2026 remix (Sonnet 5 as default, WAIC 2026, DeepSeek V4-Pro, "GPT-6 Astra", token-volume figures) was written as current news at production time. Re-check every figure and name before reusing any of it.
- The G7 task note on screen literally says "做一个节奏天国风格的视频" (names a real game series). In new films describe the genre, don't name it.

## Switching the text to English

All strings are literals in `main_b.js` (and three in `main_v1.js`):
1. Level cards: `card(SECT.gN, 'GAME N', '<name>', '<years>', …)`; the name auto-shrinks to 720 px.
2. Year banners: `banner(g, '<year>', '<name>', '<subtitle>', col)`; widths auto-measure.
3. Remix: `item(i, m0, m1, '<label>', …)`, `plate(p, '<text>')`, the month ribbon `` `${m}月` `` and the finale label `'2026 · 未完待续'`, `'还没唱完 →'`.
4. Props: quiz `QA` pairs, the Watson sign, the "9.11 和 9.9" chalkboard, the task note, the users counter label `'用户'`, report card title + `lines`, the credit text, the title `chars()` strings. In `main_v1.js`: the robot chest label `'注意力'` (`robotT`) and the sentence tokens in G3.
5. Prefer `F.round` (Fredoka) for Latin headings and keep `F.sans` for body; `init()` preloads fonts from the page's own text, so no font list changes are needed. English runs ~1.6× wider than Chinese: check banners and plates with stills.
6. Re-run `make_srt.py` if shouts change; the shouts are already English.

```

All commands from `styles/game-show/demo/` (the scripts also `chdir` there themselves). `PY=../../../.venv/bin/python`.

1. **Plan on the grid.** Fill `SECT` (first bar of each level card) in `main_b.js`, set `END_BAR` via the replace in `assemble.py`, add the card bars to `CUTS`, and write a cue list: which beats get which `ev()`.
2. **Shouts:** add lines to `voices/lines3.txt`, then `sh make_voices.sh out/voices_new` (macOS `say` + ffmpeg), listen, copy the keepers into `voices/`, add the names to `VO` in `music.py`.
3. **Build the page:** `$PY assemble.py && $PY build.py`.
4. **Look at it:** `STILLS_DIR=out/check node render.mjs stills 5.5 20.4 45 78.3 116.5 145` (≈1 s for six frames). Or open `index.html?t=78.3` in a browser.
5. **Events:** `node render.mjs events` → `events.json` (demo: 474 events, `dur 148.80`).
6. **Score + mix:** `$PY music.py` → `music.wav` (≈2 s; deterministic, seed 7). `$PY music.py out/test.wav` writes elsewhere.
7. **Render:** `node render.mjs video 2` → `out/seg_0..1.mp4` + `out/list.txt`. The demo used 6 workers (120 s total); on a shared machine keep 2 (≈3–4 min). `SEGS=5 node render.mjs video 6` re-renders only one of 6 equal segments.
8. **Finish:** `sh finish.sh out/test.mp4` (concat → loudnorm → x264 slow crf 16 + AAC 256k 48 kHz). With no argument it writes `../game-show.mp4` and **overwrites the library film** (back it up first). `AUDIO_FROM=old.mp4 sh finish.sh …` skips the remix and copies the old film's audio track unchanged (used for the sign-off re-render).
9. **Subtitles:** `$PY make_srt.py` → `../game-show.srt`.
10. **Review:** `ffmpeg -i out/test.mp4 -vf fps=1/4,scale=384:-1,tile=6x7 -frames:v 1 out/sheet.jpg` plus stills around every slam.

### Pitfalls we hit

- **`render(t)` must be a pure function of `t`.** The remix thumbnails only updated while `t < t1 + 0.01`, so their final pose depended on having rendered the frames before. The 6-worker render starts worker 5 cold at 124.0 s, and in the shipped v3 film the bottom thumbnails (robot arm stack, dancing robots, bar chart, Gemini card) show their *initial* state from 124.0 s to 131.2 s. Fixed in `main_b.js` during import (the thumbnail is recomputed at `t1 − 0.001` every frame), and the film's last segment (124.0–148.8 s) was re-rendered with the fix.
- **`main.js` and `index.html` are generated.** Edit `main_v1.js` (palette, beat helpers, banner/judge/burst, 1990s robots) or `main_b.js` (characters v2, stage, all scenes, render/init), then run `assemble.py` → `build.py`. Edits made straight into `main.js` are overwritten.
- **`BPM` and `END_BAR` are patched by string replace** in `assemble.py` (`'const BPM = 140,'` → 150, `'const END_BAR = 61;'` → 93). If you edit those lines in `main_v1.js` the replace silently stops matching. Change the replace targets instead.
- **Add every new shout in three places**: the `.wav` in `voices/`, a line in `voices/lines*.txt` (so it can be regenerated), and the `VO` list at the top of `music.py` (otherwise `KeyError`).
- **Level card bars must also be listed** in `CUTS` (`init()` in `main_b.js`: the flash) and in the `jingle()` loop + `PLAN` spans of `music.py`. They are three separate lists.
- `synth_lib.py` allocates a fixed `DUR = 150.0` s buffer. A longer film needs a bigger `DUR` or the tail is cut.
- Fonts: `measure()` uses a canvas, so glyph widths are wrong until the webfont has loaded. `init()` loads every family for the page text before `buildAll()` and again for the built stage text. Keep that when adding text.
- `say` pronunciation: write "A. I.", "G P T one", "Nine point eleven", "Move thirty seven" — spelled-out forms.
- The frame template (`frame_head.html`, inherited from an earlier film) still declares `#paper`/`#fx` canvases and ink/boil filters; `init()` hides the canvases and the style doesn't use the filters. Leave them alone or delete them together.
- zsh does not word-split `$TS`; pass timestamps as an array (`TS=(1 2 3); … $TS`) or literally.

## Engine reference

**Contract.** `buildAll()` calls `scene(t0, t1, build)` once per set. `build(g, s)` creates all SVG nodes inside group `g` once and returns `update(t)`, which only sets attributes. `render(t)` shows the scenes with `t0 ≤ t < t1`, calls their `update(t)`, then applies camera punch, cut flash and final fade. `update(t)` must depend on `t` only.

**Minimal new level** (inside `buildAll()` in `main_b.js`; add `g8: 67` to `SECT` and shift later sections, add bar 67 to `CUTS`, `jingle(at(67))` + a `span(68, 75, 'funk')` in `music.py`, and raise `END_BAR`):

```js
{ const b0 = SECT.g8 + 1, T = (bar, bt = 0) => at(b0 + bar, bt);
  card(SECT.g8, 'GAME 8', '开源接力', '2026', K.orange, '#FF9E5E',
       (p) => { const w = el('g', { transform: 'scale(2)' }, p); pawn(w, K.white); });
  scene(T(0), T(8), (g, s) => {
    bg(g, '#FFB870'); stripes(g, '#FFA85A', 50, -20);
    el('rect', { x: 0, y: 880, width: 1920, height: 200, fill: '#E08A4A' }, g);
    const w = el('g', {}, g); const c = CAST.claude(w);
    const calls = [T(0, 0), T(0, 1), T(1, 0), T(1, 1)], answers = [T(0, 2), T(0, 3), T(1, 2), T(1, 3)];
    calls.forEach(t0 => { ev(t0, 'v:hey'); punch(t0, 0.015); });
    answers.forEach(t0 => { ev(t0, 'pop', { f: 900 }); s.fx.push(burst(g, 960, 420, t0, K.yellow, 0.8)); });
    const b1 = banner(g, '2026', '开源接力', '一拍一棒，接住就赢', K.orange);
    s.fx.push(judge(g, 'Perfect!', 960, 300, T(7, 3), K.pink, 0.8));
    ev(T(7, 3), 'slam'); punch(T(7, 3), 0.05);
    return (t) => {
      tf(w, 960, 880 + hopY(t, 20), 1);
      poseAny(c, { hey: heyAt(answers, t) ? 1 : 0, open: heyAt(calls, t), sq: hitSq(t, nearestIn(answers, t) ?? -9) });
      bannerAnim(b1, t, T(0), T(8));
      s.fx.forEach(f => f(t));
    };
  });
}
```

Then `assemble.py → build.py → stills → events → music.py → video → finish.sh`.
