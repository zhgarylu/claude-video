# Paper Pop-up Book — our demo

One example among many. Don't reuse its story, arc, shots, props or timings.

Demo: *The Little Sprite's Adventure* (*Pip's Paper Adventure*, 小精灵冒险记) (133.0 s, 1920×1080, 60 fps) · `paper-popup.mp4` · source in [`demo/`](demo/) · engine: three.js r170 (WebGL2) rendered frame by frame in headless Chrome, Canvas2D for all paper art, Python for score editing and mixing


## Story & structure

A storybook opens on a real wooden desk and becomes a stage; at the end the hero jumps off the page into the real room.

How the demo used the native moves:

| Native power | Story use in the demo |
|---|---|
| **The book opens** | The opening is a physical ritual: a closed book, a creak, the cover swings up and the world pops up piece by piece with a sparkle. It is the "once upon a time". |
| **Page turn = scene change** | Each chapter is one spread. Transitions are real page turns: a curved sheet whose front is the old ground and whose back is the new sky, while the old pop-ups fold down and the new ones spring up. No cuts inside the book. |
| **Paper mechanisms** | Pull-tab tricks are story beats: a sun on a stick that rises from behind the hills and sinks at dusk, a door on a hinge, a river of three wave strips that slide, a sky of **four slats that flip from day to night** like a three-sided billboard, a moon and stars that drop in on strings. |
| **Paper as character** | A crumpled-up grump (Crumple) is **smoothed out** and poofs into a folded paper plane (Fold), who becomes a friend and later a vehicle. |
| **The edge of the page** | The last page is unfinished (pencil sketches, "The End" printed on the ground); the hero looks out past the edge, jumps, and lands on the real desk under the real lamp. |
| **The real light was always there** | At dusk "another light came on" is the actual desk lamp brightening over the page. The payoff: "a reading lamp… and someone, reading along." |

Story shape: real desk establishing (10 s) → book opens → Chapter 1 home world and the hero's wish (the light beyond the page) → Chapter 2 an obstacle character, beaten by stomping and then *helped* (smoothed out), who turns into a companion → Chapter 3 a journey with a gag (a whale spouts confetti) and a day → night flip → Final Chapter: the blank last page, fear, "Here goes!" → the companion catches the hero and they fly out over the desk → landing, reveal, "Hello, big world!" → end title on the desk with "The End?".

How we suggested adapting it at the time (kept for history; STYLE.md §11 now gives the range): make the topic's world the book's spreads (3–4 chapters, each with one paper mechanism), give the hero one wish that points *outside* the book, and end by crossing into the real room.

## Shots

A single virtual macro camera, fov 30 (56 for the reverse shot), keyed as `[t, pos xyz, target xyz, fov, aperture, focus]` in `main.js SH` and interpolated with a monotone cubic (`track`). Each inner list is one continuous shot; a new list = a hard cut.

| Beat | Camera |
|---|---|
| Establishing | High over the desk (1.1 m away), slow descending dolly towards the closed book; lamp dust motes in the light beam. |
| Book opens | Settles low and frontal on the page while the cover stands up; the sparkle rises. |
| In the book | Eye level with the paper actors: camera 5–10 cm above the page, 30–45 cm back, focus on the actor (aperture 2.2–2.5, shallow). Slow lateral moves that follow walks. |
| Page turn | Pull up and back to a 3/4 view of the whole spread (aperture 1.8–2, deeper) so the turning page reads, then drop into the new world. |
| Emotional close | Push in to 28 cm on the face (aperture 2.5). |
| Edge of the page | **Reverse shot**: camera behind Pip (fov 56, focus 11 cm) looking out past the page edge at the real, blurred room and the huge lamp. The only time we see "outside". |
| Flight out | Cut to a wide front view of the desk (1 m, fov 32); the plane is followed across the desk, then the camera settles low at Pip's height on the wood (aperture 4, focus ~0.52 m). |
| End | Slow pull back and up to reveal the whole desk, the open book behind, for the end title. |

Depth of field (`post.js`): CoC in pixels, max 14, 64-tap golden-angle spiral gather.

## Motion numbers

- Pop-ups: `back(seg(t, t0, t0+.55), 1.7)`; each piece's delay is `(.3 − z) × 1.2` s after its spread's `RISE` time; pieces near the back lie back (`dir −1`), others fall forward face-down (`dir +1`).
- Sway: `sin(1.6t + phase) × sway` around the base (0.01–0.08 rad).
- Characters: pose quantized to 1/40; eyes `open/happy/wide/closed/dizzy`, mouth `smile/open/o/grin/worried/determined`, blink every 3.7 s. Walk = legs swing by `sin(phase)`, bounce `|sin(phase)| × 1.2 mm`, arms counter-swing; phase advances 1.8 cm per half step. Turning: `S.face = cos(...)` animates the `scale.x` flip (FrontSide front drawing, BackSide back-of-head drawing).
- Jumps: `arc(t, t0, t1, a, b, h)` + squash on take-off and landing (`land`, `crouch` in `pipState`) + paper-puff cloud.
- Page turn (`book.setLeaf(u)`): 40-segment strip, `φ = θ·(1 − L·(s − ½))`, bend `L = .55·sin(πu)`, eased with `eio` over 2.3 s.
- Mechanisms: four sky slats flip 0.28 s apart; the door swings with `back()`; river strips slide ±12 mm on each "swish" of the narration.

## Score structure

- **Narration**: one warm storyteller, Kokoro `af_bella`, speed 0.9, en-us; 15 short lines (2–9 s), written like a picture book ("The cardboard hills. The paper sun on its wooden stick."). Lines pronounced differently from how they are displayed live in `tts/lines.json` (e.g. "Swish Swash Sea" without the hyphen; "..." instead of "…"); displayed text lives in `story.js VO`. Trim silence at 1 % of peak (+10 ms head, +100 ms tail). Every line checked with whisper (`asr.py`, `words.py` for word times to sync gags).
- **Character blips**: bubbles type at 30 chars/s, a blip every second letter; Pip = square wave, bright pitches (C6-ish), Crumple = low 180–240 Hz, Fold = triangle wave.
- **Music**: three Kevin MacLeod tracks (CC BY 4.0), edited in `music/edit.py`: *Dreamy Flashback* (0–16.2 s, fade out 1.6 s) for the real desk; *Jaunty Gumption* from 15.4 s for the whole paper world, with **one bar-aligned internal jump cut** (73.21 s → 102.79 s of the track, 0.42 s crossfade) chosen by `music/jump.py`/`jump2.py` (beat-synced chroma + MFCC self-similarity, cut length a multiple of 4 beats) so that the song's real ending lands at 104.22 s — the instant Pip jumps off the page; *Heartwarming* from its 39.38 s mark at 104.8 s (×1.15) for the real world and the end card.
- **Sound effects**, all synthesized in `mix.py` from `events.json` (250 events exported by `render.mjs events`): book creak + thump, pop-up pops (sine sweep + paper crinkle), page swish, door squeak, boing, hops, footsteps (tiny taps + crinkle on each walk half-cycle), paper roll, "!" bang, stomps, NICE/GREAT arpeggios, sparkles (bells), poof, paper folding, whoosh, splash, whale spout, slat clacks, star tinks, lamp switch + warm chord, landing skid. Per-type gains in the `G` table.
- **Ambience beds** per spread: room tone + clock ticks on the desk, birds + river in the valley, crickets at dusk, birds + leaf rustle in the forest, waves at sea, room tone on the last page and in the real world.
- **Mix**: voice high-passed 90 Hz, compressed (−24 dB, 3:1), limited, set 8.5 dB above the music in speech regions; music ducked by 40 % under speech (300 ms smoothing); 7 % reverb on voice; SFX limited per channel to 0.5; ambience ×2. Normalise to 0.89 peak, then `mux.sh` applies `loudnorm I=−14 TP=−1.2 LRA=11`.

## Palette & props

**Scale (metres):** book page 0.44 × 0.30 (`BW`, `BD`), page block height `PG` = 0.0175. Pip is `H = 0.036` tall, Crumple 0.042, the paper plane 0.052 long, the whale 0.10 wide, the boat 0.062. Hills 0.2–0.26 wide, trees 0.05–0.16 tall. Camera near plane 0.004 m.

**The desk:** walnut table, desk lamp, teacup, alarm clock, pencil, potted plant (Poly Haven CC0); `lythwood_lounge_2k.hdr` as environment and background (blurriness .22, yaw 2.3), walnut veneer (`#c9a88a` tint, env .8), a procedural pencil. The book: hardcover 44 × 30 cm, spine on the far side, the cover swings to 90° and stands behind the page as a painted sky.

**Cut-paper finish** (`paper.js finishCut(art, border, o)`), 16+ angles on three rings (r, .66r, .33r): grey cardboard edge `#b9ad9c`, border + 2.5 px, offset 1.5 px down; off-white border `#fffdf7`, 12–16 px (static props 14 px at 5200 px/m, characters 16 px); 512 px grain texture at alpha .5–.85.

**Drawing** (`art.js`): ink `#3a2a24`, outline 9 px (`LW`), detail 5 px (`LW2`); `crescent(x, path, shade, dx, dy, base)`; `blob`, `smoothClosed` with 3-harmonic noise. Faces: big black oval eyes with two white highlights, curved mouth, pink cheeks.

| Use | Colours |
|---|---|
| Home valley | grass `#86c763`→`#9fd57a`, hills `#b5e39a` `#a9dd8c` `#8fd06e` (shade `#6fb553`), path `#ecd49a`, sky `#7cc6ef`→`#c9ecf7` |
| Forest | ground `#4f8f46`→`#62a653`, back pines `#8cc9a0`, front pines `#3f9a5c`, sky `#a8e0cf` with light shafts |
| Sea | waves light→dark `#9ad8f5` `#79c3ee` `#58ade3` `#3f95d6` `#2f7fc4`, sky day `#4fb3ea`, night `#131d44`→`#4a5a94` |
| Last page | cream paper `#f5eedc`, graphite pencil lines `rgba(70,72,82,.45)`, IM Fell English "The End" |
| Hero Pip | skin `#ffe2bd` (shade `#f3c393`), leaf cap `#62c24c`/`#3e9a34`, tunic `#3fa1de`/`#2a78b3`, boots `#8a5530`, wings `#d4f3ff` |
| Accents | mushroom-house red `#e8413a`, sun `#ffd766`, sign/banner gold `#ffcf3f`, ribbon red `#d8423a` |
| Book | cloth `#1f5566`, gold foil `#e0b456` (metalness map), page edges `#efe6d2` with fine lines |

**Pop-up pieces** (`cutmesh.js cutMesh`): back colour `#efe8da` (or `#8a5a34` for the door) via `onBeforeCompile`; `alphaTest .5` + `alphaToCoverage`; `customDepthMaterial`. The boat = sail card behind + hull card in front; Fold = four triangles hinged on a keel.

**Fonts:** Fredoka 500/600/700 (subtitles, bubbles, signs), Lilita One (cover, chapter banners, action words, end title), IM Fell English (cover tagline, "The End", "The End?"), ZCOOL KuaiLe (Chinese). All OFL, downloaded to `demo/fonts/` by `fetch_fonts.mjs` (Chinese subset = only the characters in the source files).

**Titles and subtitles as built:**
- Narration subtitles (`hud.js drawSubs`): English Fredoka 500 40 px, cream `#fffaf0`, 8 px dark-brown outline, soft shadow, wrap at 1720 px; Chinese in ZCOOL KuaiLe 32 px below. Fade in 0.3 s before the line, hold until 0.25 s after the audio, fade 0.3 s.
- Speech bubbles (`drawBubbles`): radius 44, 6 px ink outline, soft drop shadow, tail projected from 3D every frame, pops in with `back()`, English at 30 chars/s (Fredoka 600 46 px), then the Chinese (ZCOOL KuaiLe 32 px, `#7a5e4c`) and a bobbing red "next" triangle.
- Chapter banners (`drawChapter`): a hanging cardboard sign on two strings, red ribbon "Chapter N", title in Lilita One 84 px gold `#ffcf3f` with a 12 px ink stroke, Chinese under it.
- Action words (`drawAction`, `drawBang`): "NICE!" / "GREAT!" in italic Lilita One 120 px, gradient fill, white + ink double stroke, rays; a red "!" over the startled hero.
- Title: the book cover (cloth texture + gold-foil "The Little Sprite's Adventure ~ a paper tale ~" with a roughness/metalness map, and a round Pip illustration).
- A bilingual `.srt` is generated from `story.js` (`make_srt.mjs`): narration + bubbles, English line then Chinese line.

## End card

`drawEnd`, from 123.4 s, over the live desk shot: title in Lilita One 96 px gold (y 170), Chinese title (y 262), italic "The End?" popping in (y 350), then from 127.6 s the sign-off and the asset credits (22 px, y 960/998/1036; the Chinese row uses `'"ZCOOL KuaiLe", Fredoka'`) fade in together; fade to black over the last 1.5 s.

The sign-off **"LemoLab × Claude Opus 5.5"** (× = U+00D7) belongs to this library's demo only; a user's film carries no LemoLab credit and no copy of this card. In the demo it sits centred under "The End?" at y 430: Fredoka 600 36 px, cream `#fffaf0` fill with a 7 px `rgba(30,20,14,.75)` outline (it lies over the cream backdrop page, so the outline is what makes it read), fading in with the asset credits at 127.6 s, never covering the characters.

## Pitfalls tied to this demo

- **A single-plane boat hid the character sitting in it**: split into sail (behind, z −3 mm) and hull (in front, z +2 mm) with Pip between them.
- **Foreground blur**: forest ferns and a bush at 20.9 s filled the frame near the lens.
- **Mixer bug**: passing a stereo (N×2) array to a 1-D limiter silently crushed all SFX to −96 dB. Limit each channel separately.
- **Shadow settings that worked**: spot shadow map 4096², bias −6e-5, normalBias 4e-4. Leaf materials: emissive map = colour map, emissive .42.
- **Headless WebGL speed**: default Chrome uses SwiftShader (~620 ms/frame); `--use-angle=gl --enable-gpu --ignore-gpu-blocklist` gives tens of ms per frame on Apple Silicon. Serve over HTTP (`serve.mjs`, started inside `render.mjs`).
- **Poly Haven API**: Python `urllib` gets 403; download with `curl`.
- **Font subsetting**: `fetch_fonts.mjs` only includes characters present in `story.js/hud.js/main.js/art.js` at download time. The ZCOOL KuaiLe subset has no Latin glyphs, so Latin words in the Chinese credit row fell back to a system serif; use `'"ZCOOL KuaiLe", Fredoka'`.
- **Redraw cost**: Pip's canvases are redrawn only when the pose (quantized to 1/40) changes.

Helpers: `shot.mjs page.html out.png` (screenshot any page, e.g. `sheet.html` = character & prop model sheet), `probe.mjs '<js expr>'` (evaluate inside the loaded scene; `window.DBG` exposes pip/boat/fold/whale/book/cam), `gltest.mjs` (GPU flag benchmark), `tile.py` (contact sheet of stills), `music/survey.py` (tempo/loudness survey of candidate tracks). The generic `node core/render/still.mjs styles/paper-popup/demo 30` also works (the page uses only relative URLs).

## Engine reference

**Coordinates.** World = metres, y up; desk top at y = −PG relative to the page. `book.stage` is the page frame: x ∈ [−0.22, 0.22] left→right, z ∈ [0, 0.30] from the spine (far) to the reader (near), y up from the page. `book.sky` is the standing backdrop frame (after the cover opens): x as above, y ∈ [0, 0.30] up the backdrop, small +z = in front of it. Characters go in `book.stage`; hanging clouds/moon/stars go in `book.sky`.

**Page contract** (what `render.mjs` needs): `window.READY = true` after assets load; `window.render(t)` draws second `t` deterministically; `window.DUR`; `window.EV = [{t, type, …}]` for `mix.py` (types listed in "Score structure"; add a new branch in `mix.py` for a new type).

**Minimal example** — a new spread with one pop-up hill, a hero walking on it and a page-turn camera, inside `main.js`-style code:

To reuse the engine for a different film (your own story, not this one), copy the engine files, write a new `story.js` (lines, bubbles, chapters, `OPEN`, `TURNS`, `DUR`), replace the spreads in `sets.js` (`pages()` + `buildSets`), redraw characters in `art.js`, then re-key `pipState`, the camera list `SH` and `lightsAt` in `main.js`. Keep book/paper/cutmesh/post/render/mix unchanged.
