name: lemo-opuscar
description: Direct and produce a short film made entirely in code, in one of the styles of the Lemo-Opuscar library (e.g. Impasto Oil Painting 油画厚涂, Watercolor Brush 水彩笔刷, Chinese Ink Wash 中国水墨, Ukiyo-e 浮世绘, Whiteboard Explainer 白板讲解). Use when the user asks for a video, film, short, promo, explainer or animation (视频、短片、动画、宣传片) in a named style; when they want a film made about their own topic and haven't chosen a style (help them choose); or when they ask which film styles there are; or when they bring a video of a presenter talking and want explainer graphics drawn around it (the footage is used as given). Not for editing, cutting or converting existing video files.

# Lemo-Opuscar

The styles, guides and tools live in the Lemo-Opuscar library (github.com/lemomo-ai/lemo-opuscar). This skill fetches it and hands you over to it.

1. **Get the library.** Run `sh "<skill base directory>/scripts/setup.sh"`. It clones or updates the library (default `~/lemo-opuscar`; a clone the user is standing in is used as it is) and prints `LIB=<path>` on its last line.
2. **Install the core tools early.** Start `sh "<skill base directory>/scripts/setup.sh" deps` right away, in the background if you can: it takes a few minutes the first time. Add `deps voice` or `deps music` later, only if the film needs them (`$LIB/TECHNIQUE.md` §1). Report missing system tools in your one round of questions; don't install system software yourself.
3. **Follow the library.** Read `$LIB/AGENTS.md` and do what it says: finding the style, the one round of questions, the treatment, production and delivery. If the user brings a presenter's video, also read `$LIB/TALKING-HEAD.md`.

What changes in skill mode:

| | |
|---|---|
| Project folder | `<name>/` in the folder the user started from (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; avoid `#` and `?` in the path). Wherever the guides say `films/<name>/`, read this folder |
| Running tools | from `$LIB`, with the project's absolute path: `cd "$LIB" && node core/render/still.mjs "<project>" 1.5 3` |
| Library files in pages | absolute URLs: `/core/lib.js`, `/node_modules/three/…` (the project is served at `/@film/`) |
| Library files in scripts and `build.sh` | `$LIB/…`, with `LIB=<path>` at the top of `build.sh`; never `../..` |
| Demo source | not downloaded. `sh "<skill base directory>/scripts/setup.sh" demo <slug>`, only after your `TREATMENT.md` is written, to read its techniques; it is not meant to be rendered |

Deliver what `$LIB/DIRECTOR.md` §11 lists, in the project folder, and tell the user where it is.
